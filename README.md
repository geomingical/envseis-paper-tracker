# EnvSeis Paper Tracker

A curated collection of **585 environmental seismology papers** (1982–2026), organized by topic and browsable as a static GitHub Pages site.

🔗 **Live site**: [geomingical.github.io/envseis-paper-tracker](https://geomingical.github.io/envseis-paper-tracker/)

---

## Features

- **8 topic categories** — Landslide, Debris Flow, Glacier, River, Hydrology, Volcano, Seismic Methods & ML, Other
- **Interactive timeline** — filter papers by publication year
- **Checkbox selection** — pick papers and download as JSON or CSV
- **Learning Mode** — build a personal study collection with Markdown reading notes

---

## About the Summary Field

Each paper includes a short **Summary** shown in the detail modal. These summaries are **generated by a large language model (LLM)** based on the paper's title and abstract, condensed into an IMRaD-style overview (Introduction, Methods, Results, and Discussion).

> ⚠️ **Summaries are AI-generated and for reference only.** They may contain inaccuracies or miss important nuances. Always refer to the original paper for authoritative content.

## Learning Mode — How to Use

Learning Mode lets you build a personal study collection with reading notes. It works in two ways:

### Option A: Git-First (Recommended)

Best for long-term use. Notes are version-controlled and persist across sessions.

**Step-by-step:**

1. **Fork** this repository to your own GitHub account
2. On the main page, **check the papers** you want to study
3. Click **Download** → choose **JSON**
4. Save the downloaded file as `learning/papers.json` in your fork
5. Commit and push — your Learning page will automatically load the papers

```
your-fork/
├── learning/
│   ├── papers.json       ← your selected papers (from Download)
│   ├── chang-2025.md     ← reading note (example included)
│   └── ...
```

### Option B: Upload Fallback

For quick previews without forking. Drag & drop a JSON or CSV file onto the Learning page. Data is temporary and will be lost on refresh.

## Writing Reading Notes

Reading notes are plain Markdown files stored in the `learning/` folder. The filename must match the paper's ID.

### Finding the Paper ID

Each paper has a short ID in the format `{first-author-surname}-{year}`, e.g. `chang-2025`. You can find it:
- On each card in Learning Mode (shown in the top-right corner)
- In the detail modal
- In the downloaded JSON (`"id"` field)

### Creating a Note

Create a file named `learning/{paper-id}.md`. For example, for the paper with ID `chang-2025`:

```
learning/chang-2025.md
```

Write your notes in Markdown. There is no required format — use whatever structure works for you. Here is a suggested template:

```markdown
# Key Findings

- Main result 1
- Main result 2

## Methods
- Method or technique used
- Analysis approach

## My Thoughts
- Questions or ideas for follow-up
- Connections to other papers
```

### Example

See [`learning/chang-2025.md`](learning/chang-2025.md) for a complete example based on:

> Chang et al. (2025) — *Unraveling landslide failure mechanisms with seismic signal analysis for enhanced pre-survey understanding*

---

## Sample `papers.json`

A sample `learning/papers.json` is included with one entry (`chang-2025`) so you can see the expected format. Replace or extend it with your own selection from the Download button.

The format is a JSON array of paper objects:

```json
[
  {
    "id": "chang-2025",
    "title": "Unraveling landslide failure mechanisms with seismic signal analysis...",
    "authors": ["Jui‐Ming Chang", "Che‐Ming Yang", "..."],
    "year": 2025,
    "category": "landslide",
    "journal": "Natural hazards and earth system sciences",
    "doi": "",
    "url": "",
    "summary": "This study likely explores landslide failure mechanisms..."
  }
]
```

Required fields: `id`, `title`. All other fields are optional but recommended for a good display.
