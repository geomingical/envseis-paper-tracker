# Key Findings

- Three distinct events identified from seismic spectrograms — Event 1 was the most substantial
- Event 1 consisted of four sliding failures within 30 s with decreasing mass
- Events 2 and 3 were minor toppling and rockfalls, respectively
- Sliding direction from single-force inversion: 153.67° (geological survey: ~148°)
- Volume estimation: 557,118 m³ (geological survey: 664,926 m³) — good agreement

## Methods
- Spectrogram analysis (DFT + discrete Stockwell transform with semi-log frequency axis)
- Single-force inversion for sliding direction and mass estimation
- Geohazard location for source constraint
- Comparison with drone survey, field geology, and event video

## Failure Mechanism
- Retrogressive failure sequence: shear-off from the toe → retrogression → widening
- Imbrication-like deposit features support retrogressive interpretation
- Gravitational slope deformation observed in geomorphological survey

## Significance
- Demonstrates seismic analysis as a pre-survey tool for geologists
- Remote + adjacent station configuration enables full characterization
- Provides time-resolved physical process information before field visit

## Questions
- Can this workflow be generalized to other deep-seated landslide types?
- How does station distance affect single-force inversion accuracy?
- Could real-time spectrogram monitoring enable early warning?
