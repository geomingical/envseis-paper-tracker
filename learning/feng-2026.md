# Key Findings

- dv/v serves as a proxy for groundwater level monitoring
- Soil moisture alone does not explain variations in total water storage
- Subsurface moisture can be decoupled from the deep-water table

## Methods
- Single-station cross-correlation technique
- 10-year continuous seismic data from Utah seismic network
- Comparison with GRACE satellite data

## Notes
- Important for semi-arid region hydrology monitoring
- Could be applied to other regions with dense seismic networks
