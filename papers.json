      "abstract": "Ongoing climate change is leading to an increase in prolonged droughts and severe weather events, which are particularly pronounced in semi‐arid regions, such as the western United States. These extremes could have lasting social and environmental impacts. Continuous monitoring of near‐surface hydrological processes and groundwater resources provides helpful information for effective water resource management. The seismological signature of groundwater fluctuations is clear in the temporal variations in seismic velocities, dv/v. To this end, developing a proxy for groundwater level using dv/v represents an opportunity, but further understanding of the relation between dv/v and subsurface hydrology is required. In this study, we apply single‐station cross‐component correlation analysis to 28 broadband seismic stations in Utah between January 2006 and March 2023 and analyze the dv/v in the 2–4 Hz frequency band. To explain dv/v, we linearly superimpose thermoelastic stresses, soil moisture estimated from remote sensing data products, and a long‐term deep water table pore pressure. We find that the relative contributions of each depend on the location. Still, adding a long‐term water table decline, which is not systematically observed in soil moisture, better fits our data. We conclude that soil moisture alone does not explain the variations in total water storage when subsurface moisture is decoupled from the deep‐water table. We also conclude that dv/v can be used as a proxy for water storage.",

      "abstract": "Abstract. Subglacial lakes beneath Antarctic glaciers are pivotal in advancing our understanding of cryosphere dynamics, basal hydrology, and microbial ecosystems. We investigate the internal structure and physical properties of Subglacial Lake D2 (SLD2), which is located beneath David Glacier in East Antarctica, using seismic data acquired during the 2021/22 austral summer. The dataset underwent a comprehensive processing workflow, including noise attenuation, velocity analysis, and prestack time migration. The migrated seismic sections revealed distinct reverse-polarity reflections at the glacier–lake interface; however, reflections from the lake–bed sediment interface were ambiguous, leading to interpretational uncertainty about the presence of a sediment layer. To resolve this interpretational uncertainty, two alternative structural models were established: Model 1 (no sediment) and Model 2 (with a sediment layer). Synthetic seismograms generated by wave-propagation modeling were compared with field data to validate the subglacial lake structure. The results confirmed the water column thickness to be approximately 82 m (Model 1) or approximately 10 m (Model 2), and possible structural scenarios for the subglacial lake were presented. Additionally, discontinuous reflections detected in seismic sections transverse to the ice flow were interpreted as scour-like feature surfaces formed by ice movement. This study identified the basal structure beneath the subglacial lake, which had been challenging to identify with conventional radar surveys, through seismic surveying. In addition, ambiguous signals in the field seismic data were mitigated via quantitative comparison with synthetic data, thereby facilitating interpretation of the underlying structure. Collectively, these findings enhance our understanding of subglacial lake environments and inform the selection of future drilling sites for in situ sampling.",

These events were identified in near real‐time through seismic data and later confirmed using satellite imagery, tidal records, and infrasound. The landslides generated a modest tsunami, and a 4 cm wave was recorded by a tide gauge 18 km away, marking the first recorded landslide to reach water since monitoring began in this region in 2021.

      "abstract": "The nonlinear mechanical responses of rocks and soils to seismic waves play an important role in earthquake physics, influencing ground motion from source to site. Continuous geophysical monitoring, such as ambient noise interferometry, has revealed co‐seismic wave speed reductions extending tens of kilometers from earthquake sources. However, the mechanisms governing these changes remain challenging to model, especially at regional scales. Using a nonlinear damage model constrained by laboratory experiments, we develop and apply an open‐source 3D discontinuous Galerkin method to simulate regional co‐seismic wave speed changes during the 2015 Mw 7.8 Gorkha earthquake. We find pronounced spatial variations of co‐seismic wave speed reduction, ranging from <0.01% to >50%, particularly close to the source and within the Kathmandu Basin, while disagreement with observations remains. The most significant reduction occurs within the sedimentary basin and varies with basin depths, whereas wave speed reductions correlate with the fault slip distribution near the source. By comparing ground motions from simulations with elastic, viscoelastic, elastoplastic, and nonlinear damage rheologies, we demonstrate that the nonlinear damage model effectively captures low‐frequency ground motion amplification due to strain‐dependent wave speed reductions in soft sediments. We verify the accuracy of our approach through comparisons with analytical solutions and assess its scalability on high‐performance computing systems. The model shows near‐linear strong and weak scaling up to 2,048 nodes, enabling efficient large‐scale simulations. Our findings provide a physics‐based framework to quantify nonlinear earthquake effects and emphasize the importance of damage‐induced wave speed variations for seismic hazard assessment and ground motion predictions.",

      "abstract": "Most public seismic recordings, sampled at hundreds of Hz, tend to be unlabelled, i.e., not catalogued, mainly because of the sheer volume of samples and the amount of time needed by experts to confidently label detected events. This is especially challenging for very low signal-to-noise ratio microseismic events that characterise landslides during rock and soil mass displacement. Whilst numerous supervised machine learning models have been proposed to classify landslide events, they rely on a large amount of labelled datasets. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop tools to effectively automate the data-labelling process from a small set of labelled samples. In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised method for labelling of signals recorded by seismometers that can reduce the time and expertise needed to create fully annotated datasets. The proposed Siamese network approach learns best class-exemplar anchors, leveraging learned similarity between these anchor embeddings and unlabelled signals. Classification is performed via soft-labelling and thresholding instead of hard class boundaries. Furthermore, network output explainability is used to explain misclassifications and we demonstrate the effect of anchors on performance, via ablation studies. The proposed approach classifies four landslide classes, namely earthquakes, micro-quakes, rockfall and anthropogenic noise, demonstrating good agreement with manually detected events while requiring few training data to be effective, hence reducing the time needed for labelling and updating models.",

Acoustic-based devices provide a promising way to measure the transport rate with established calibration relationships between the signal and bedload particles. We have developed a novel acoustic bedload monitoring system with phased microphone arrays (PMA) and an accelerometer to identify the particle impact location and to better determine the particle size. Impact experiments with glass and quartz spheres in a flume setting were performed to investigate the dynamic signal response of the PMA monitoring system for varying particle size and impact location. For a similar virtual set-up, the conventional beamforming method was used to determine the source characteristics of the acoustic wave on the scanning plane of the PMA structure. The model provides a calculation of the cross-power matrix of the recorded pressures generated by bedload which localizes the particle impacts on the plate. The results show separate correlation relationships between bedload grain size and three key signal characteristics: the number of signal impulses per particle mass, the amplitude, and the centroid frequency. The findings of this study contribute to the measurement of the bedload transport with the PMA system, which helps to localize the bedload impact positions and improves the predictions of particle size.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Submarine melting is one of the major mechanisms of ice loss from marine-terminating glaciers and ice shelves, but its contribution is yet to be fully understood. Here, we demonstrate the feasibility of monitoring melting using passive underwater acoustics, by sensing the loud crackling sound produced during melting due to the release of pressurised ice-trapped bubbles. We profile the acoustic field in glacial bays in Svalbard using a hydrophone array and show that the sound level in the bay contains clues on the melt activity. The sound level’s interpretation is hindered by its spatial variability, which we suppress using a model of melt-induced acoustic activity. Thereby, we show that the sound generated at the glacier terminus is correlated with the ablation rate at the calving glacier front and the water temperature and thus linked to the melt rate. This marks a step forward in using passive acoustics to monitor submarine melt, paving the way for an autonomous, long-term, large-scale monitoring tool providing data that can inform assessments and simulations of ice sheet loss and sea level rise.",

      "abstract": "\n The grounding zone of a marine-terminating glacier, where ice begins to float, is a key control on glacier stability and ice discharge. Seismic deployments are a powerful means of studying both the geometry and processes of grounding zones; however, these regions are frequently inaccessible and dangerous for field work, and as a result are underrepresented in field studies. We report new data sets acquired at Eastwind Glacier, Antarctica, a relatively accessible grounding zone near McMurdo Station and Scott Base, as part of the Eastwind Glacier Geophysical Surveys on Top of an Antarctic Ice Shelf Transition, EGGS on TOAST, project. These data sets comprise a deployment of three-component seismic nodes and distributed acoustic sensing. The nodal deployment consisted of 330 nodes crossing the grounding zone, with all 330 nodes continuously recording for at least nine days, and 150 nodes recording for 19 days, in the austral summer of 2022/2023. Hammer-and-plate sources were recorded, with densely spaced shots along flow through the center of the array and shots located at every node. In 2023/2024, a 2.2 km fiber-optic cable was deployed for active source imaging by distributed acoustic sensing along and across flow, immediately downstream of the grounding line, for a period of 2 hr. Analysis of active source data recorded by the nodal array locates the point of flotation within the grounding zone and provides ice thickness estimates. We present initial analyses of passive source data, including icequake detection and location, and ambient noise analysis. We expect this data set to be of significant value to provide insight into fundamental grounding zone processes and as an event-rich cryoseismological data set on which to test novel methods of seismic analysis.",
      "summary": "This study investigates the grounding zone of Eastwind Glacier in Antarctica, a critical area for glacier stability.

      "abstract": "Passive ambient noise monitoring is an emerging tool in environmental seismology, leveraging the ambient seismic field to assess temporal variations in shallow subsurface properties. This review focuses on the potential and challenges of using scattered coda waves from noise correlation functions to monitor critical zone dynamics. The sensitivity of seismic velocities to various environmental factors, including precipitation, snowmelt, atmospheric pressure, and groundwater fluctuations, underscores the method’s versatility. While coda waves excel in detecting subtle changes due to their scattered nature, ballistic waves provide higher spatial resolution, albeit with challenges in source stability. Advances in seismic sensing, including distributed acoustic sensing and low-cost geophone networks, have enabled high-resolution monitoring of hydrological processes, subsurface deformation, and seismic hazards. Integrating seismic data with hydrological models provides insights into water storage, pore pressure changes, and soil moisture dynamics. However, limitations in spatial resolution, calibration with ground truth data, and coupled effects between environmental factors remain key challenges. This review emphasizes the importance of interdisciplinary approaches in refining methodologies, enhancing sensor deployments, and addressing data gaps. Passive seismic monitoring offers opportunities to understand critical zone processes and their broader impacts on seismic hazards and environmental sustainability.",

      "abstract": "Combining observation well data and Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) deformation has shown great promise in groundwater levels monitoring and aquifer parameters estimation, which is crucial for groundwater management and related natural hazards anticipating. However, insufficient observation wells bring a drawback of this means in obtaining high spatial resolution results. Here, we employ a machine learning approach, the optimizable Gaussian regression learner, to integrate these two datasets to derive pixel-scale groundwater levels across Los Angeles and Orange County from Jun. 2015 to Nov. 2021. The results are validated with groundwater levels revealed from relative changes in seismic velocity (dv/v) measured at a dense network. With the innovative results, we found an interesting phenomenon that the groundwater levels show an overall rising trend during the study period, which is prominent in the San Gabriel Valley and the Coastal Plain of Orange County (CPOC) basins with mean rate of 0.78 ± 0.04 and 0.31 ± 0.05 m/yr, respectively. Besides, the strongest seasonal groundwater level changes are observed in the CPOC with mean annual amplitude of 0.97 ± 0.16 mm, which results in seasonal ground deformation for 3.58 ± 0.51 mm. Moreover, by analyzing the long-term hydraulic head records in these two basins, we identify that the rising trends should be attributed to ∼ 6.5-year interannual variations. Our study underlines the importance of integrating multitemporal InSAR data with hydraulic head measurements to accurately quantify changes in groundwater levels, determine aquifer parameters, and assess variations in groundwater storage.",

      "abstract": "Abstract. Monitoring snow avalanche activity is essential for operational avalanche forecasting and the successful implementation of mitigation measures to ensure safety in mountain regions. To facilitate and automate the monitoring process, avalanche detection systems equipped with seismic sensors can provide a cost-effective solution. Still, automatically distinguishing avalanche signals from other sources in seismic data remains challenging. This is mainly due to the complexity of seismic signals generated by avalanches, the complex signal transmission through the ground, the relatively rare occurrence of avalanches, and the presence of multiple sources in seismic data. To study and interpret the variety of these signals, we compiled a dataset of seismograms recorded with an array of five seismometers installed in an avalanche study site above Davos, Switzerland. For the winter seasons of 2020–2021 and 2021–2022, this dataset comprised 84 avalanches and 828 noise (unrelated to avalanches) events. An approach to automate the detection of avalanches in seismic data is by applying machine learning methods. So far, research in this area has mainly focused on extracting domain-specific signal attributes as input features for statistical models. In contrast, we propose a novel application of representation learning from seismograms using autoencoder models to automatically extract features from 10 s seismic signals of snow avalanches. On top of that, we applied random forest classifiers to evaluate whether these features facilitate the detection of avalanches. Concretely, we trained one random forest classifier each on a set of expert-engineered seismic attributes (baseline), temporal autoencoder features and spectral autoencoder features. The classifiers achieved an avalanche recall of 0.67 (±0.00) (baseline), 0.71 (±0.02) (temporal autoencoder) and 0.70 (±0.01) (spectral autoencoder) and macro average f1-scores of 0.78 (±0.00) (baseline), 0.70 (±0.01) (temporal autoencoder) and 0.77 (±0.01) (spectral autoencoder). The developed approach could be potentially used as an operational, near real-time avalanche detection system. Yet, the relatively high number of false alarms still needs further implementation of the current automated seismic classification algorithms for effective avalanche detection.",

The paper aims to detect and interpret changes in bedload transport regimes during high‐magnitude flood events in an Alpine braided reach (La Séveraisse, French Alps) using continuous seismic monitoring. For the seven investigated floods identified over the 5 years of record, we observe a consistent break in the scaling relationship between the low‐frequency seismic power and the high‐frequency seismic power, suggesting a change in bedload transport regime linked to sediment mobility. Using time‐lapse cameras and hydrological conditions, we find this breakpoint is associated with significant morphological changes occurring at Shields stress ratios approaching a critical value of 2. Based on these results and existing literature, we suggest the break in seismic power corresponds to a transition in bedload regime associated with the disruption of the bed armour layer and particle dynamics being highly influenced by grain–grain interactions.

Landslide hazards negatively impact the economy and public through disruption, damage of infrastructure and even loss of life. Triggering factors leading to landslides are broadly understood, typically associated with rainfall, geological conditions and steep topography. However, early warning at slope scale of an imminent landslide is more challenging. Through semi-supervised learning for seismic event detection from continuous seismic recordings over a period of about 10 years, we demonstrate that timely landslide induced displacement prediction is possible, providing the basis for landslide early warning systems. Our proposed methodology detects and characterises seismic precursors to landslide events making use of seismic recordings near an active slow moving earth slide-flow using a semi-supervised Siamese network. This data driven methodology identifies increase in microseismicity, and the change in the frequency spectrum of that microseismicity which identify key stages prior to a failure: ‘rest’, ‘precursor’ and ‘active’.

      "abstract": "\n Ambient noise interferometry is widely used to detect subsurface changes. These measurements primarily rely on Rayleigh waves or coda waves, with the latter typically interpreted as Rayleigh waves through the application of the diffusion approximation based on the selected lapse window. Converting or inverting the detected changes in Rayleigh- or coda-wave velocity into stress changes requires an understanding of how body-wave velocity responds to stress changes—a relationship defined by stress sensitivity. In this study, we extract stress sensitivity from laboratory experiments and demonstrate that it decreases dramatically with confining pressure and, consequently, with depth. We further collect field measurements to support this relationship. On this basis, we conduct synthetic tests to show that temporal changes in low-frequency (0.05–1 Hz) Rayleigh-wave velocity related to static stress changes may predominantly reflect conditions within the uppermost 1 km of the crust, as shallow S-wave velocities are much more sensitive to stress perturbations than deeper ones. We review previous seismological observations and identify inconsistencies in some interpretations when the depth dependence of stress sensitivity is overlooked, suggesting that the depth corresponding to the detected velocity change may be much shallower than claimed in some previous studies. Our results provide a theoretical foundation by establishing the quantitative relationship between body-wave velocity changes and stress changes, which can improve the interpretation of temporal variations in wavespeeds and emphasize the need for careful analysis given the complexities of real-Earth observations.",

      "abstract": "In early 2023, a series of intense atmospheric-river storms eased California's historic drought, yet the spatiotemporal extent of groundwater recovery remains poorly understood. We tracked two-decadal changes in groundwater in Greater Los Angeles using seismic ambient-field interferometry. The derived seismic hydrographs reveal distinct expressions of groundwater and surficial water droughts: Whereas surface and near-surface water storage nearly fully recovered in the epic wet season of 2023, only about 25% of the groundwater lost since 2006 was restored. On a decadal scale, we find substantial depletion in aquifers below 50-meter depth, with only limited storm-related recovery. Our analysis underscores the need to monitor deep aquifers for a more complete assessment of total water deficits, using high-resolution tools such as seismic sensing.",

The 2021 Chamoli rockslide and subsequent floods in India highlighted the need for effective monitoring and early warning systems. Recent studies demonstrated the potential of seismic monitoring for detecting such events in real time. However, accurate detection and differentiation of landslide seismic signals from earthquakes, and background noise remains critical. This article discusses a novel approach based on trend changes in Power Spectral Density (PSD) for distinguishing landslide-generated waveforms. The average PSDs were computed for earthquakes of small magnitude, landslides, and noise data from landslide-prone regions globally. These average PSDs serve as a global model for identifying the landslides in continuous seismic data. The distinct trends with slopes of −1.00, −7.42, and −8.78, respectively, noticed in the average PSD of earthquakes, landslides, and noise data from the global dataset, suggest this as a novel approach for realtime monitoring.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Ground-based time-lapse cameras are often used to monitor glacier recession, which is primarily driven by the falling of ice from the glacier front, known as iceberg calving or, more commonly, calving events. Glaciologists can utilise these images by manually identifying calving events, a laborious task that requires the analysis of thousands of images in order to identify image pairs that represent the glacier front before, during and after calving. We present a computer vision based method to filter out images rendered unusable due to weather effects such as fog and precipitation by calculating the number of salient key-points detected in the image using the SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform) algorithm as an indicator of the visibility of the glacier front and discarding any image with fewer key-points than a defined threshold. We propose the use of SNN (Siamese neural network) and show that it is useful in detecting calving events since it allows to separately calculate features on two images and then merges them together in order to track differences between them thus detecting calving areas. The trained model achieved an overall accuracy of 92%, with 79% of calving events and 93% of non-calving being correctly classified on an unseen test set formed from imagery in the same time period as the training data. The model was able to generalise to new time periods (and therefore small changes in viewpoint and alignment) to some extent with an overall accuracy of 82%, with 27% of calving events and 90% of non-calving being correctly classified.",

      "abstract": "The advent of machine learning has significantly improved the accuracy of identifying mass movements through the seismic waves they generate, making it possible to implement real‐time early warning systems for debris flows. However, we lack a profound understanding of the effective seismic features and the limitations of different machine learning models. In this work, we investigate eighty seismic features and three machine learning models for single‐station‐based binary debris flow classification and multi‐station‐based warning tasks. These seismic features, derived from physical and statistical knowledge of impact sources, are grouped into five sets: Benford's law, waveform, spectra, spectrogram, and network. The machine learning models belong to two families: two ensemble models, Random Forest and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost); one recurrent neural network model, Long Short‐Term Memory (LSTM). We analyzed feature importance from the ensemble models and found that the number and even the types of seismic features are not critical for training an effective binary classifier for debris flow. When using models designed to capture patterns in sequential data rather than focusing on information only in one given window, using the LSTM does not significantly improve the performance of binary debris flow classification task over Random Forest and XGBoost. For the multi‐station‐based debris flow warning task, the LSTM model predicts debris flow probability more consistently and provides longer warning times. Our proposed framework simplifies machine learning‐driven debris flow classification and lays the foundation for affordable seismic signal‐driven early warning using a sparse seismic network.",

      "abstract": "The forces exerted by geophysical granular flows on Earth's surface, and the resulting seismic signals, can be used to monitor natural geohazards and understand their dynamic evolution and characteristics. Substantial research has focused on linking basal force fluctuations and seismic signals to granular flow dynamics. However, the mechanisms behind the generation and evolution of seismic signals remain incompletely understood. In this study, we conducted laboratory flume experiments to gain insights into the evolution and characteristics of basal force fluctuations and seismic signals and explored their relationship with the macroscopic properties of granular flows. Our results show that the shear and normal components of basal force fluctuations exhibit different behavior during flow evolution, which are related to variations in flow velocity fluctuations. As the granular flow moves downstream, shear basal force fluctuations decrease due to weakening velocity fluctuations, whereas normal force fluctuations increase. Similar to basal force fluctuations, seismic signals follow a generalized Pareto distribution. Basal force fluctuations and seismic signals are strongly nonlinearly related to the bulk flow properties, indicating that thicker, denser and faster flows generate stronger basal force fluctuations and more intense seismic signals. However, particle size significantly influences this relationship. We demonstrate that the inertial number, characterizing the macroscopic rheological properties of granular flows, can unify basal force fluctuations and seismic signals across different particle sizes, exhibiting a negative correlation on the temporal scale. This implies that the macroscopic rheological behavior of granular flows may provide critical insights into the mechanisms of generation and evolution of seismic signals.",

      "abstract": "Quantifying bedload transport and its processes is a key challenge in river research and has been a topic of study for decades. In Austria, bedload transport is continuously monitored at seven sites, ranging from high‐altitude Alpine regions to the Danube River, for over one decade. The investigated catchment areas range from 56 km2 to 104,177 km2. Direct measurement methods, including various bedload samplers, as well as indirect measurement methods, in this case, plate geophones, were used. Thus, the bed load transport of all flood events that occurred during the project period from 2010 to 2021 was recorded. Bedload transport and bedload yield could be determined on a station‐specific basis using calibrated plate geophones and if possible, at the monitoring site with the bedload rating curve approach. A total of 2,848 individual measurements were conducted, using various bedload basket samplers, and 49 measurements with slot samplers. The mean annual bedload load at the observed sites ranges from 4,500 t to 360,000 t at the monitored catchment area. However, the annual loads are subject to significant fluctuations, depending on hydrology and catchment size. Long‐term monitoring has shown that reliable conclusions can be drawn about bedload transport and its dependence on discharge and anthropogenic influences. The correlation between discharge and bedload transport tends to be weaker in smaller catchments.",

      "abstract": "Tête Rousse glacier is a small polythermal glacier in the Mont‐Blanc massif (French Alps) that released a large outburst flood in 1892 when a water‐filled intraglacial cavity suddenly drained. A new water‐filled cavity was detected again in the central part of the glacier by a geophysical campaign in 2007. It has been pumped three times since to avoid another catastrophic flood. The volume of water in this central reservoir has decreased recently but recent geophysical surveys suggested that significant volumes of water could be stored in the upper part of the glacier. Here, we describe a seismic tremor signal detected in May 2022 probably generated by a water‐filled reservoir within the glacier. The tremor started on 15 May a few days after temperature first increased above 0°C. Tremor amplitude was stronger in the evening and is correlated with water level measured in a crevasse about 230 m downglacier. The time delay between temperature and tremor or water level is consistent with the time needed for water to infiltrate within the snow and into the glacier. We used different methods to locate this signal both from amplitude decay and from P and S waves arrival times. Both methods provide a similar location near the northern boundary of the glacier. Ground penetrating radar surveys performed in May 2024 have since detected a water‐filled reservoir near this location. These results validate our interpretation of this seismic tremor being produced by changes in water‐level in this reservoir.",

      "abstract": "Abstract We analyse seismic time series collected during experimental campaigns in the area of the David Glacier, Victoria Land, Antarctica, between 2003 and 2016. We observe hundreds of repeating seismic events, characterized by highly correlated waveforms (cross-correlation > 0.95), which mainly occur in the grounding zone, i.e. the region where the ice transitions from grounded ice sheet to freely floating ice shelf. The joint analysis of seismic events and observed local tidal measurements suggests that seismicity is not only triggered by a regular, periodic driver such as the ocean tides but also more likely by transient pulses. We consider potential environmental processes and their impact on the coupling between the glacier flow and the bedrock brittle failure. Among the environmental variables examined, our findings suggest that clustered and repeated seismic events may be related to transient episodes of ice-mass discharge correlated to a change in the subglacial hydrographic system that originates upstream of the glacier, lubricating the interface with the bedrock. This hypothesis is supported by the gravity variation observations provided by the GRACE satellite mission, which observed mass variations during periods characterized by seismic clustering.",

      "abstract": "Abstract. Alluvial rivers respond to external forcings such as variations in sediment supply, water supply and base level by aggrading, incising and adjusting the rates at which they transport sediment. These processes are recorded by landforms, such as terraces and fans, that develop along river courses, and by stratigraphy in downstream sedimentary basins. Many concepts we use to interpret such records are derived from models that treat alluvial rivers as single-segment streams: for example, the length of an alluvial river has been shown to set its response time to external forcing. However, alluvial rivers in nature exist within interconnected networks, complicating the application of such concepts to real systems. We therefore adapted a model describing long-profile evolution and sediment transport by transport-limited, gravel-bed alluvial rivers to account for network structure, and explored the response of large numbers of synthetic networks to sinusoidally varying sediment and water supply. We show that, in some respects, networks behave similarly to single-segment models. In particular, single-segment models predict well properties that integrate across the entire network, such as the total sediment output. We use this behaviour to define an empirical network response time, and show that this response time scales with network mean length, or the mean distance from all a network's inlets to its outlet. Nevertheless, interactions between segments do lead to complex signal propagation within networks: amplitudes and timings of aggradation and incision vary between minor tributaries and major trunk streams, and between upstream and downstream parts of the network, in ways that depend on each individual network's structure. We conclude that, while single-segment models may be useful for some applications, detailed studies of specific catchments require a modelling framework that accounts for their specific network structure.",

They then explored the response of synthetic river networks to changing sediment and water supply.

      "abstract": "To manage debris flows, it is critical to both recognize potential impact mechanisms and evaluate, via physical models, associated impact forces. Seismic signals can be used to detect flows and infer flow properties, but inferring flow characteristics in channels with check dams and upslope deposits remains challenging. In this study, we conducted laboratory flume experiments to investigate the influence of varying flume inclination and pre‐retained material (deposition upslope of the barrier) height on flow characteristics and impact mechanisms, and analyzed their correlation with seismic signals. The objective was to examine the impact of deposition upslope of the barrier on interactions between debris flows and check dams by combining seismic and dynamic parameters. We found that a frequency domain feature‐based method can successfully filter out noisy signals. Results showed that it is possible to distinguish the impact mechanism of a granular flow in the presence of deposition upslope of the barrier from the seismic signals' attributes, that is, the peak signal amplitude envelope before granular flow overflow and its ratio to the peak amplitude of the control test without the barrier. Furthermore, the presence of check dams and upslope deposits in the debris flow channel significantly reduces the sensitivity of seismic signals to flow velocity. A key advantage of using the peak amplitude of the seismic signals generated by debris flows for identifying the impact mechanism is the potential for enhanced safety and cost‐effectiveness compared with contact monitoring instruments such as force plates.",

This study examines the impact of particle composition on granular flow dynamics and seismic signal generation under various flow regimes using flume experiments under dam break conditions. By varying particle composition and flume inclination angles, we investigate the kinematic properties, seismic responses, and the relationship between flow regimes and seismic signal characteristics. The results reveal that particle composition significantly affects flow dynamics, with peak velocity exhibiting a non‐monotonic dependence on particle size, and an optimal proportion of large particles maximizing mobility. Seismic signals, including peak amplitude and power spectral density, increase with larger particle sizes and steeper inclination angles, indicating a strong coupling between flow dynamics and seismic responses. A two‐segment positive correlation between seismic signals and collisional stress highlights the role of flow regimes, with particle‐ground impacts during intense collisional interactions dominating seismic signal generation, we then introduce a dimensionless amplitude parameter and establish a unified correlation with the Savage number across flow regimes. This study advances the understanding of granular flow dynamics and seismic signatures, providing a framework for interpreting seismic data in debris flow monitoring and hazard assessment. Future work to explore the interplay of frictional and collisional mechanisms to refine models of granular flow behavior and physical interpretation of seismic data is warranted.",

However, investigating deep soil moisture dynamics at large scales presents significant challenges due to the sparse distribution and limited spatial representativeness of in situ monitoring networks, while various remote sensing methods mainly address surface soil moisture within the top few centimeters. This study illustrates how seismic waves can effectively detect variations in deep soil moisture. We examine continuous seismic data from 791 stations across South‐Central Europe for the period 2016–2020. Our findings confirm a strong correlation between variations in seismic velocity and deep soil moisture content.

      "abstract": "We investigate strategies to mitigate the impact of environmental noise and surface influences in long-term monitoring of subsurface reservoirs using the borehole-deployable Portable Active Seismic Source (B-PASS). Unlike traditional surface seismic sources, the B-PASS system minimizes the impact of surface environmental factors such as temperature fluctuations and groundwater variations. This capability makes it particularly effective for long-term applications, especially CO2 storage monitoring. Field tests of B-PASS were conducted in a gas field underlain by a shallow, highly attenuating beach sand. This study tested two source configurations: vertical motion and horizontal motion. By stacking the repeatable signals from B-PASS, we achieved effective noise reduction and enhanced the quality of the seismic signal. The source remained deployed in the borehole for 10 days; stability was quantitatively assessed over 7 days comprising approximately 8,000 sweeps., with stacking providing an hourly temporal resolution. The results demonstrated significant signal propagation to the farthest receiver, located approximately 450 m away, even through a highly attenuating layer. Deeper source deployment proved advantageous, enhancing the signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio for P-waves by up to five times compared to a surface source. The field experiments further demonstrated that environmental noise significantly influenced signal propagation, and midnight was identified as the optimal operational period due to less ambient noise. Therefore, by considering the daily temporal variation of the S/N ratio of the field before the long-term monitoring, we can identify the optimal operation time of the monitoring. To determine the optimal number of signal stacks, we developed a method to evaluate how the S/N ratio varies with stacking number and offset (source–receiver distance). Based on these results, the B-PASS demonstrates its potential as a reliable solution for continuous monitoring, even in geologically challenging environments with surface attenuation and noise, by optimizing the daily monitoring schedule and the number of signal stacks.",

We applied this method in the Lyon water catchment area, utilizing train tremors as a continuous and stable seismic source. The case study demonstrates that seismic attenuation variations correlate strongly with environmental factors such as rainfall and significant changes in the water table due to a flood event.

Here, we employ seismic interferometry of the ambient noise field and the trace stretching method to monitor seismic velocity variations in Mexico City. We present spatiotemporal variations in relative Rayleigh wave group velocity (dU/U) $(dU/U)$ calculated over two frequency bands (0.4–1.2 Hz and 1.2–3.6 Hz) using DAS data collected over a year. To investigate these variations, we model the impacts resulting from the 2022 Mw7.6 earthquake, along with the effects of precipitation and temperature on the dU/U $dU/U$ calculated in the 0.4–1.2 Hz frequency band, which is primarily dominated by the fundamental mode of the Rayleigh waves. Our results indicate that the earthquake‐induced velocity drop differs in certain fiber sections, likely due to their non‐linear soil behaviors and co‐seismic stress changes but without relation to the maximum local deformation registered during the earthquake. Additionally, our modeling indicates that the velocity changes are influenced by seasonal temperature variations, and the impact of precipitation is relatively minor, at least for the depth range ( <∼ ${< } \\sim $ 50 m) examined in this study. This study highlights the capability of DAS to enhance spatiotemporal monitoring in urban environments, providing valuable insights into both seismic and environmental responses.",

      "abstract": "Despite the existence of various hydrological and geophysical methods for characterizing the vadose zone and groundwater, it remains challenging to implement cost‐effective, accurate, and efficient techniques for their long‐term monitoring with high spatial resolution. A growing number of recent studies suggest that seismological methods based on continuous seismic noise recording can potentially address these difficulties. This study presents an original laboratory experiment aimed at assessing the sensitivity of passive seismic interferometry imaging (PII) to controlled fluctuations in water content. To achieve this, we used the recording of the seismic noise generated by a continuous seismic source to reconstruct ballistic surface Rayleigh waves propagating in the [200–500] Hz range within a 1‐m scale sandbox. Multiple controlled cycles of water imbibition and drainage at the base of the sandbox produce significant variations in the seismic wavefield and especially in dominant surface waves. The large relative velocity variations δv/v $\\delta v/v$ (−35%), measured in Rayleigh waves with a fine temporal resolution, match the water pressure measurements conducted within the sandbox. The observations are well predicted by an original theoretical approach combining a Biot‐Gassmann‐Wood poroelastic model that incorporates effective pressure fluctuations and the frequency‐dependent sensitivity kernels of Rayleigh waves. These results confirm the potential of the PII method in monitoring saturation changes in the vadose zone as well as the substantial effect of effective pressure fluctuations, at least when Rayleigh waves dominate ballistic arrivals.",

      "abstract": "Exploring the presence and behavior of water on Mars is critical for understanding the planet’s geological evolution, hydrological processes, and potential habitability, which has been a central objective of past and ongoing Martian exploration missions. Martian geomorphology provides evidence of ancient groundwater activity, but confirmation of present-day liquid water remains limited. Here, we infer near-surface brines confined to meter-scale depths in regions north of about 30 °N in the northern hemisphere, based on the analysis of seasonal variations in marsquake seismicity and thermal modeling. The absence of seasonal marsquakes during colder periods and their abrupt resurgence in warmer seasons can be explained by ice-to-brine phase transitions. Our findings reveal a mechanism whereby seasonal melting of subsurface ice elevates pore pressure and lubricates faults, leading to a reduction in frictional strength, and ultimately inducing marsquakes. This mechanism accounts for the seasonal variation, clustering, high seismic b-values, and shallow focal depths of seasonal marsquakes. Additionally, we estimate that the melting point of briny ice on Mars is below approximately 250 ± 13 K, advancing our understanding of Mars’ present-day brine cycle and near-surface hydrological processes. The study finds that seasonal marsquake patterns may indicate active near-surface brines on Mars today. By connecting seismicity changes to ice-to-brine melting, it infers that shallow liquid water continues to operate beneath the surface and influence Martian fault activity.",

      "abstract": "Turbidity currents carve Earth’s deepest canyons, form Earth’s largest sediment deposits, and break seabed telecommunications cables. Directly measuring turbidity currents is notoriously challenging due to their destructive impact on instruments within their path. This is especially the case for canyon-flushing flows that can travel >1000 km at >5 m/s, whose dynamics are poorly understood. We deployed ocean-bottom seismometers safely outside turbidity currents, and used emitted seismic signals to remotely monitor canyon-flushing events. By analyzing seismic power variations with distance and signal polarization, we distinguish signals generated by turbulence and sediment transport and document the evolving internal speed and structure of flows. Flow-fronts have dense near-bed layers comprising multiple surges with 5-to-30-minute durations, continuing for many hours. Fastest surges occur 30–60 minutes behind the flow-front, providing momentum that sustains flow-fronts for >1000 km. Our results highlight surging within dense near-bed layers as a key driver of turbidity currents’ long-distance runout. Turbidity currents are driven by surge dynamics within their frontal cell, with fast surges from behind providing momentum to sustain flow fronts for over 1000 km, suggests analysis of ocean-bottom seismometer data of internal flow speed and structure",

      "abstract": "Large-scale ring laser gyroscopes (RLGs) are essential scientific instruments to study a variety of geophysical phenomena. The first and so far only large-scale RLG array ROMY (ROtational Motions in seismologY) comprises four triangular, heterolithic, active RLGs and can provide high-quality, three-component rotational ground motion observations. Compared to other RLGs, often being located in underground laboratories, ROMY is a near-surface installation that is more exposed to environmental influences. The prototype design of ROMY could serve as a blueprint for high-sensitivity, six degree-of-freedom stations for geoscientific rotation sensing. Understanding and quantifying instrumental effects caused by its environment is, therefore, essential to enhance the design toward a stable and continuous operation. Geometric deformation of a heterolithic optical ring resonator introduces undesired instrumental drifts that are challenging to mitigate. Applying a classic correction for backscatter-induced errors, we achieve a reduction in short-term Sagnac frequency fluctuations of several millihertz. A new sensor network inside ROMY monitors key environmental parameters such as barometric pressure and temperature. In order to quantify deformation of the resonator, we use camera-based beam tracking and free spectral range measurements. Based on these observations, we discuss the current operational stability of ROMY and recovery methods. We relate the observed instrumental drifts to dominant environmental drivers. Using a linear, multivariate modeling approach, we can identify dominant drivers and reduce long-term drifts of the Sagnac frequency. A quantification and better understanding of environment-induced instrumental effects allows to develop strategies for a further improvement in operational stability.",

      "abstract": "Monitoring groundwater tables (GWTs) remains challenging due to limited spatial and temporal observations. This study introduces an innovative approach combining an artificial neural network, specifically a multilayer perceptron (MLP), with continuous passive Multichannel Analysis of Surface Waves (passive‐MASW) to construct GWT depth maps. The geologically well‐constrained study site includes two piezometers and a permanent 2D geophone array recording train‐induced surface waves. At each point of the array, dispersion curves (DCs), displaying Rayleigh‐wave phase velocities VR $\\left({V}_{R}\\right)$ over a frequency range of 5–50 Hz, were measured daily from December 2022 to September 2023, and latter resampled over wavelengths from 4 to 15 m, to focus on the expected GWT depths (1–5 m). Nine months of daily VR ${V}_{R}$ data near one piezometer, spanning both low and high water periods, were used to train the MLP model. GWT depths were then estimated across the geophone array, producing daily GWT maps. The model's performance was evaluated by comparing inferred GWT depths with observed measurements at the second piezometer. Results show a coefficient of determination (R2) of 80% at the training piezometer and of 68% at the test piezometer, and a remarkably low root‐mean‐square error (RMSE) of 0.03 m at both locations. These findings highlight the potential of deep learning to estimate GWT maps from seismic data with spatially limited piezometric information, offering a practical and efficient solution for monitoring groundwater dynamics across large spatial extents.",

This observation has been linked to relaxation, a phenomenon observed in a wide range of materials after straining perturbations, but systematic controls on the recovery duration in the shallow subsurface after earthquake ground shaking have not been determined. Here, we analyse the effects of two successive large earthquakes and their aftershocks on ground properties using estimates of seismic velocity from ambient noise interferometry. We show that the relaxation time scale is a constant that is an intrinsic property of the substrate, independent of the intensity of ground shaking. Our study highlights the predictability of earthquake damage dynamics in the shallow subsurface and also in other materials. This finding may be reconciled with existing state variable frameworks by considering the superposition of different populations of damaged contacts. A study in the Atacama Desert shows that the recovery pace of damaged subsurface materials after large earthquakes is set by the material properties, not ground shaking intensity. This finding can help postseismic hazard mitigation and reconstruction.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Continuous monitoring of seismogenic faults can advance our understanding of the evolution process, holding important keys for forecasting future earthquakes. We report here seismic velocity variations around the Anninghe fault zone in southwest China based on seismic interferometry techniques. We observed that tidal forces significantly impact velocity changes within the fault fracture zone, inducing periodic changes in seismic velocity on diurnal, semidiurnal and monthly scales. Moreover, the response to Earth tides is notably more pronounced in the fault fracture zone compared to other areas. This can be attributed to tidal forces affecting the opening and closing of cracks in the subsurface medium. Due to the higher density of fractures within the fault fracture zone, it becomes more sensitive to tidal forces. Our findings underscore the crucial role of tidal forces in perturbing stress within the fault zone during periods when earthquakes have not occurred.",

The research indicates that tidal forces correlate with periodic changes in seismic velocity at various scales.

      "abstract": "Abstract. Antarctica is mostly covered by snow, firn, and glacier ice, and the transformation from snow to firn and glacier ice influences energy transfer and material transport in polar regions. In this paper, we deployed three linear seismic arrays near Dome A in East Antarctica during China's 39th and 40th Antarctic scientific expeditions and used seismic ambient-noise to reconstruct the firn structure nearby. The result shows that the ambient noise mainly comes from the Kunlun Station and is related to human activities. We resolved the empirical Green's function that contains abundant multi-modal surface waves from 3 to 35 Hz, and reconstructed the shallow S-wave velocity, density, and radial anisotropy structures by inverting them. The reliability of the structure was validated by the ice-core data, which demonstrates the effectiveness of using cultural seismic noise for the reconstruction of shallow structures in Antarctica. The result shows that the S-wave velocity increases rapidly with a weak negative radial anisotropy (SH wave travels slower than SV wave) in the top 28 m, which corresponds to the transformation from snow to firn. The firn layer shows a fairly strong positive radial anisotropy (SH wave travels faster than SV wave) between 40 and 70 m in depth. The radial anisotropy vanishes to zero at around 84 m in depth, denoting the transformation from firn to glacier ice. Overall, the multi-parameter results clearly show the transformation from snow to ice, and the internal evolution of firn at the Dome A region. Furthermore, we compared several existing S-wave velocity profiles of firn structures from different areas in Antarctica, which indicate relatively higher S-wave velocities at the same depth in the four study areas located in West Antarctica.",

      "abstract": "Variations in ambient seismic noise generated by the Kyngarga river (Tunka Valley) in the calm state and during significantly rising water levels were analyzed, based on the Arshan short-period seismic station data, observations of water level fluctuations at the Kyngarga Rv. hydrological station, and the amount of rainfall measured with precipitation gauge at Peak Lyubvi mountain (Mt). The methods used in the work include the correlation, spectral, spectral-temporal and polarization analyses. Ambient noise vibrations recorded at the Arshan seismic station show instable over time and show significant seasonal variations. During warm periods, the ice cover melting increases the water level in the Kyngarga River, thus causing amplification of seismic vibrations in the frequency range from 2 to 20 Hz. Occurrence of heavy rainfalls and subsequent significant rise in the Kyngarga river water levels (floods) lead to changes in the amplitude-to-frequency response characteristics of ambient seismic noise. This translates into amplification of seismic vibrations in the frequency range from 4 to 20 Hz, with maximum seismic radiation (radiative transfer of seismic waves) in the 6–10 Hz frequency range. For different floods, the amplification varies significantly and depends on the magnitude of the water level rise. Variation of amplitude-frequency characteristics of the ambient seismic noise in summer relative to winter, as well as during floods, is driven by increased water flow turbulence with affiliated increase in water flow velocity and discharge, and sediment dynamics. Diagrams showing particle motion in the medium in a calm state and during floods do not show any dominant orientation of oscillations, which is associated with the length of the source of vibrations whose extent (in this case) is equal to the entire river channel.",
      "summary": "Variations in ambient seismic noise generated by the Kyngarga river (Tunka Valley) in the calm state and during significantly rising water levels were analyzed, based on the Arshan short-period seismic station data, observations of water level fluctuations at the Kyngarga Rv. hydrological station, and the amount of rainfall measured with precipitation gauge at Peak Lyubvi mountain (Mt). The methods used in the work include the correlation, spectral, spectral-temporal and polarization analyses. Ambient noise vibrations recorded at the Arshan seismic station show instable over time and show significant seasonal variations. For different floods, the amplification varies significantly and depends on the magnitude of the water level rise.",

      "abstract": "Relative seismic velocity changes (dv/v) $(dv/v)$ are being increasingly used to monitor changes in groundwater. However, it remains challenging to verify its implementation in watersheds without direct groundwater well measurements. In this study, we conduct a 12‐year dv/v $dv/v$ observation in a watershed of the Yellowstone National Park (YNP). We find that the seasonal fluctuations and long‐term trend of the measured dv/v $dv/v$ are highly correlated with the estimated baseflow, which serves as a constraint for groundwater changes. We integrate the estimated baseflow into a poroelastic mechanism and conduct two dv/v $dv/v$ simulations based on pressure diffusion. These simulations closely match with our observed dv/v $dv/v$ variations. In addition, our analysis suggest that the measured dv/v $dv/v$ is primarily influenced by hydrologic pressure diffusion rather than surface air temperature. We conclude that the baseflow analysis can further enhance the seismic monitoring of groundwater changes.",

Seismic methods show promise for continuous monitoring of bedload transport. However, comparisons with direct bedload measurements are required for calibration and validation, and few such data sets exist. We collected high temporal resolution seismic and bedload flux data from 19 flash flood events that occurred during 5 years at the Arroyo de los Pinos experimental watershed in central New Mexico. We use this data set to investigate the variation of seismic signals with bedload flux across events. To compare seismic and bedload data, we first isolated seismic power‐spectral density (PSD) in the 30–80 Hz frequency range, largely to exclude local noise sources. Next, we computed the linear regression of recorded PSD with bedload flux measurements to determine the robustness of correlation. We found a good correlation between median PSD in the 30–80 Hz range and bedload flux (Spearman's ρ = 0.77). To further investigate variation in the bedload‐PSD relationship, we sieved sediment captured in bedload samplers and determined variations in PSD according to grain size. We found a significant positive correlation between PSD and the median grain size of bedload in motion, but the peak frequencies did not correlate with grain size.",

      "abstract": "\n A key challenge in environmental seismology is processing seismic data to study source physics, natural and human‐induced forcings, and geological structures such as landslides, glaciers, and volcanoes. Seismic arrays with dozens of stations have expanded data set sizes, and this, combined with signal complexity and high noise levels, makes it difficult to analyze using traditional event detection and labeling methods especially for low‐energy or rare events. Clustering continuous data offer a comprehensive method for exploring the data sets and detecting all relevant events. In this study, we present a clustering workflow based on self‐supervised learning (SSL) designed to handle data sets ranging in size from thousands to millions of events. This approach enables automated clustering of continuous data from seismic arrays containing dozens of stations. When applied to the “Marie‐sur‐Tinée” landslide data set, our workflow processed 10 millions 30‐s windows and identified four main families: Potential Endogenous Landslide Seismic Events, Potential Regional Earthquakes, Potential Rainfall‐Induced Signals, and Noise. Despite the overall consistency, some noise remained in the event‐related clusters highlighting areas for further improvement in clustering methods. Nevertheless, the proposed SSL‐based clustering workflow shows great potential for an efficient exploration of seismic data sets of millions of events and could be a solution for the blind exploration of similarly large data sets.",

      "abstract": "Abstract. Glaciers exhibit complex hydraulic and dynamic behaviour that needs to be studied to enhance our understanding of cryospheric changes. To address this, we apply a range of passive seismic analysis techniques to continuous data from a temporary seismic array deployed on Glacier de la Plaine Morte, Switzerland. First, we assess the reliability of ambient noise horizontal-to-vertical spectral ratio (HVSR) measurements and demonstrate that the variations in HVSR curves are predominantly attributed to changing nearby noise conditions influenced by hydraulic, drainage-related tremors, moulin resonances, and anthropogenic sources. We find that short time series (e.g. hours-long) may lead to biases in the interpretation of the HVSR curve. Hence, we perform an analysis of the local noise source variations related to glacier dynamic behaviour in order to distinguish between source and medium changes reflected in the HVSR measurements. In 130 d long time series of measurements we are able to detect a spatio-temporal trend and find that an HVSR trough emerges following the sudden drainage of an ice-marginal lake. This HVSR trough is indicative of a low-seismic-velocity layer at the ice–bed interface. Seismic velocity changes derived by interferometry support our findings of a velocity drop in the glacier after the drainage. Subsequently, inversion and forward modelling of the empirical dispersion and ellipticity curves reveal a probable thickness of this low-velocity layer of 10–30 m and a change in shear-wave velocity up to 40 %. This layer has a local extent covering an estimated 4.5 % to 27 % of the glacier, as indicated by the spatial variations in the HVSR trough throughout the array and an independent water volume estimate. Our findings suggest that the changing seismic velocities are a manifestation of temporal subglacial water storage in response to the sudden injection of lake water. Our results highlight the value of long time series of HVSR measurements which show variations in the peak and trough structure that reflect hydrological changes in the subglacial environment.\n",

We studied the seismic signals emitted near rivers in two tributaries characterized by large boulders. Data show an unusually high dominant seismic frequency, reaching >2 times the frequency observed in nearby smoother channels. Consistent high‐frequency content during periods without bedload transport prompts the hypothesis that turbulence is a key contributor to generating higher frequencies. Assuming that dominant turbulent eddies decrease in size due to boulder‐constrained flow, we formulate a frequency scaling relationship that aligns well with field data. A positive relationship of the frequency with water depth breaks at bedload onset, indicating that dissipation of flow energy partitions between turbulence and bedload transport. Our study shows that seismic frequency captures contrasting bed morphologies in mountain streams, offering insights into flow‐roughness interactions.",

      "abstract": "Debris flows are fast‐flowing, high‐energy mixtures of sediment and water that are difficult to monitor. Seismic monitoring instruments can be placed safely outside the channel, but it is an indirect method that needs the application of theory‐based inversion to obtain quantitative information on flow properties and rheology. Such inversion methods do not currently exist for debris flow dynamics because the essential understanding of the relationship between the basal force and physical properties of debris flow at the channel bed is lacking. In this study, flume experiments are used to investigate the distribution of basal forces of dual‐phase solid‐liquid flows. We systematically varied particle size, bed slope, dynamic viscosity, particle dosage, and slurry dosage and measured the forces generated on the bed at high temporal resolution. We analyzed the probability density function of the basal impact force to identify distribution parameters relating to the physical properties of the flow. Evaluation of 10 fitted distributions showed that the Cauchy distribution and Dagum distribution best described the normalized basal force under different variables using objective criteria based on the Sinkhorn and Wasserstein distances. We found that the Cauchy and Dagum distributions' parameters correlate with the dose ratio and Bagnold numbers (R2 ∼ 0.588–0.844), showing the significant influence of the sediment concentration and particle collision rates on the distributions. The study contributes to developing a theoretical underpinning of debris‐flow seismic inversion.",

      "abstract": "Estimating the seismic reflectivity of the glacial ice‐bed interface is a powerful means to quantify subglacial properties, which is important for parameterizing sliding laws in ice sheet models and understanding ice sheet history. Amplitude‐versus‐angle (AVA) analysis measures reflectivity with incidence angle and is sensitive to the compressional and shear properties of the interface. Conventional AVA inversions use only reflected compressional (PP) components and are nonunique; joint inversion using compressional‐to‐shear mode conversions (PS) may mitigate this and boost the information return from a seismic survey campaign. We present an inversion scheme which inverts PP and PS‐wave AVA data for subglacial properties. Using synthetic AVA data for diverse subglacial regimes, we evaluate its performance when inverting PP data only, and jointly inverting PP and PS data, for narrow‐ and wide‐angle geometries. For the same angular range, joint inversion improves upon single inversion in both precision and accuracy; furthermore, narrow‐angle joint inversion performs comparably or favorably when compared to wide‐angle single inversion. Joint inversion improves constraint of bed properties most when subglacial materials have high Poisson's ratios. We apply the inversion scheme to data from Korff Ice Rise, West Antarctica, and find basal properties consistent with a frozen bed; single and joint inversion results are comparable. Best estimates of Z=(5.79±0.26)×106kgm−2s−1 $Z=(5.79\\pm 0.26)\\times 1{0}^{6}\\ {\\text{kg}\\,\\mathrm{m}}^{-2}{\\mathrm{s}}^{-1}$ and σ=0.298±0.010 $\\sigma =0.298\\pm 0.010$ are taken from joint inversion of wide‐angle data. We consider joint PP/PS inversion a means to utilize fully the seismic wavefield when multicomponent acquisition complements other survey aims, but care should be taken when substituting wide‐angle with multicomponent data.",

      "abstract": "Natural landslide dams pose severe hazards when they fail, and understanding their breach processes remain challenging because such events are rarely observed directly in the field. To address this gap, we conducted large‐scale overtopping experiments with compacted (CP) and non‐compacted (NCP) dams, supported by a synchronized multi‐sensor framework that combined UAV and ground‐based photogrammetry, particle tracking velocimetry, water level gauges, autonomous scouring particles, and seismic monitoring. In situ density tests confirmed that CP dams had higher dry bulk volumetric weight and lower water content (2.33 t/m3, 4.9%) than NCP dams (2.04–1.98 t/m3, 6.8%–4.4%), corresponding to compaction levels of ∼104% for CP and 88%–89% for NCP. The multi‐sensor observations captured both surface and subsurface processes throughout failure, revealing that CP dams breached rapidly with sharp peak discharges and narrow, deeply incised channels, whereas NCP dams breached more gradually, producing flatter hydrographs and wider, shallower channels. Despite these differences, the underwater cross‐sections consistently evolved toward parabolic geometries. In addition, several characteristic signatures were observed across data sets, including concentrated velocity jets in CP versus dispersed flows in NCP, and V‐shaped seismic spectrograms observed during the processes of incision and widening. Because these experiments are approximately five times larger than typical laboratory flume studies, they captured scale‐dependent behaviors not observable in smaller facilities, including slower incision rates, later peak discharges, and more gradual hydrograph development at larger scale. These findings clarify how compaction and scale jointly influence breach timing and erosion pathways and provide physically grounded constraints for improving numerical breach models and hazard assessments.",
      "summary": "This study investigates dam failure processes, which are difficult to observe directly in natural settings. Large-scale dam breach experiments were conducted using compacted and non-compacted dams with synchronized multi-sensor monitoring. The experiments revealed differences in breach characteristics related to dam compaction, such as breach timing and channel geometry. These findings may help improve numerical models and hazard assessments of dam failures.",

      "abstract": "\n In Antarctica, seismic monitoring and detection is significant for understanding long-term glacier activity, glacial melting, and other related scientific issues. We deployed 8 three-component short-period seismometers near the grounding line of the Dalk Glacier ice tongue in Southeast Antarctica, collecting seismic signals from 19 October 2022 to 28 February 2023. We applied unsupervised deep learning, using an autoencoder to encode the features of the input spectrograms into low-dimensional latent vectors, which were then input into a Gaussian mixture model for clustering. We ultimately identified four groups of microseismic signals: Group A wideband events (20–100 Hz) are associated with temperature variation; it is a group of crevasse events. Group B includes low-frequency (<20 Hz) events that may be resonances generated by fluid-filled subglacial fractures, corresponding to the minimum and maximum tidal speeds at the Dalk Glacier coast. Group C events are vibrations caused by wind, and group D events are noise from commuter vehicles. In particular, we discuss the high-energy pulse events included in group A as well as the possible potential sources of group B events. Our research results indicate that deep clustering can effectively identify various types of microseismic signals. The icequakes are closely related to glacier activity driven by environmentally related factors. This may improve further study on the internal structure of glaciers.",

Satellite-based methods are widely used for glacier velocity measurements but are limited by satellite revisit frequency. This study explores using seismic station internal GPS data to track glacier movement. While less accurate than differential GPS, this method offers high-temporal resolution as a by-product where seismic stations are deployed. Using a seismic station on Borebreen, Svalbard, we show that internal GPS provides reliable surface velocity measurements. When compared with satellite-inferred velocities, the results show a strong correlation, suggesting that the internal GPS, despite its inherent uncertainty, can serve as an efficient tool for glacier velocity monitoring. The high-temporal sampling reveals short-term dynamics of speed-up events and underscores the role of meltwater in driving these processes. This approach augments glacier observation networks at no additional cost.",

      "abstract": "Abstract. Periglacial debris flows in alpine mountains are influenced by strong earthquakes or climatic warming and play a crucial role in delivering sediment from hillslopes and downslope channels into rivers. Rapid and massive sediment supply to rivers by the debris flows has profoundly influenced the evolution of the alpine landscape. Nonetheless, there is a dearth of knowledge concerning the roles tectonic and climatic factors played in the intensified sediment erosion and transport. In order to increase our awareness of the mass wasting processes and glacier changes, five debris flows that occurred at the Zelunglung catchment of the eastern Himalayan syntaxis since the 1950 Assam earthquake were investigated in detail by field surveys and long-term remote sensing interpretation. Long-term seismic and meteorological data indicate that the four events of 1950–1984 were the legacies of the earthquake, and recent warming events drove the 2020 event. The transported sediment volume indexed with a non-vegetated area on the alluvial fan has reduced by 91 % to a stable low level nearly 40 years after 1950. It is reasonable to hypothesize that tectonic and climatic factors alternately drive the sediment supplies caused by the debris flows. High concentrations of coarse grains, intense erosion, and extreme impact force of the 2020 debris flow raised concerns about the impacts of such excess sediment inputs on the downstream river evolution and infrastructure safety. In regard to the hydrometeorological conditions of the main river, the time to evacuate the transported coarse sediments is approximately 2 orders of magnitude longer than the recurrence period of periglacial debris flows.",

Physical model experiments were designed with varying clay content to simulate debris flow motion, and micro accelerometers were employed to monitor and record vibration acceleration changes during debris flow initiation and motion. Frequency spectra were generated using Fourier transform to analyze the motion characteristics in the frequency domain. The results showed that the predominant period of debris flow initiation ranged from 15 Hz to 29 Hz, while the period during motion in the middle section of the flow area ranged from 36 Hz to 54 Hz. Higher clay particle content was associated with a decrease in both the frequency range and mean of the predominant period, as well as a reduction in the Fourier amplitude extremum. These findings provide a foundation for monitoring and predicting debris flows, and the vibration signal characteristics of debris flow initiation and motion can be used to infer the clay content, offering insights into early warning systems for such geological hazards.",

      "abstract": "Seismic ambient noise spectra ubiquitously show two amplitude peaks corresponding to distinct oceanic wave interaction mechanisms called primary (seismic period (T) ~ 14 s) and secondary (T ~ 7 s) microseism. Seismic noise records are used in a wide range of applications including crustal monitoring, imaging of the Earth's deep interior using noise correlations, and studies on the coupling between oceans and solid Earth. All of these applications could benefit from a robust knowledge of spatiotemporal dynamics of microseismic sources. Consequently, seismologists have been studying how to model microseismic sources of ambient noise with the recent improvements in ocean wave models. Global sea state and its derivative products are now covering the past decades in models such as the WAVEWATCHIII hindcast. This paper introduces the Wave Model Sources of Ambient Noise (WMSAN, pronounced [wam-san]) Python package. This modular package uses standardized wave model outputs to visualize ambient noise source maps and efficiently compute synthetics of seismic spectrograms and cross-correlations for surface waves (Rayleigh) and body waves (P, SV), in a user-friendly way.",

      "abstract": "Antarctic ice shelves regulate ice-sheet discharge and global sea-level rise, yet their rapid retreat underscores the need for new, low-cost monitoring tools. We analyze ambient seismic noise recorded by seismometers on the Pine Island Glacier ice shelf to characterize wind-induced signals and detect persistent structural resonances. Power spectral analysis shows that wind sensitivity is strongly damped compared with bedrock sites: noise increases only 5–7 dB from 0 to 25 m s−1 winds, versus a 42 dB increase at an inland bedrock station, reflecting the contrasted coupling environments of floating and grounded substrates. The horizontal-to-vertical spectral ratio (HVSR) spectrograms reveal two temporally stable peaks at ~2.2 Hz and ~4.3 Hz that persist across stations and remain independent of environmental forcing. Forward modeling indicates that these peaks correspond to S-wave resonances within the ice shelf. The inferred ice-water interface depth (~440 m) agrees with the Bedmap2 thickness estimate (466 m). This work demonstrates that HVSR provides an effective passive, single-station method for measuring ice shelf thickness.",

      "abstract": "Climate change is increasingly predisposing polar regions to large landslides. Tsunamigenic landslides have occurred recently in Greenland (Kalaallit Nunaat), but none have been reported from the eastern fjords. In September 2023, we detected the start of a 9-day-long, global 10.88-millihertz (92-second) monochromatic very-long-period (VLP) seismic signal, originating from East Greenland. In this study, we demonstrate how this event started with a glacial thinning–induced rock-ice avalanche of 25 × 106 cubic meters plunging into Dickson Fjord, triggering a 200-meter-high tsunami. Simulations show that the tsunami stabilized into a 7-meter-high long-duration seiche with a frequency (11.45 millihertz) and slow amplitude decay that were nearly identical to the seismic signal. An oscillating, fjord-transverse single force with a maximum amplitude of 5 × 1011 newtons reproduced the seismic amplitudes and their radiation pattern relative to the fjord, demonstrating how a seiche directly caused the 9-day-long seismic signal. Our findings highlight how climate change is causing cascading, hazardous feedbacks between the cryosphere, hydrosphere, and lithosphere. Editor’s summary A large rockslide occurred in Greenland on 16 September 2023 that generated a local tsunami. The event was energetic enough to generate a global signal that resonated for 9 days. Svennevig et al. used a range of geophysical tools to detail the sequence of events that occurred and then determined the origin of the global signal. The authors found that the signal was generated by standing waves in the Dickson fjord due to the rockslide. Climate change drives feedback among the cryosphere, hydrosphere, and mass wasting events, and signals such as the one the authors observed may provide a different way of understanding these interactions. —Brent Grocholski",

      "abstract": "This study utilized ambient seismic noise tomography to investigate correlations of hydrogeological systems with heterogeneous porosity with the internal velocity structure of karst aquifers using the Floridan Aquifer System (FAS) as an example. We conducted a seismic signal analysis with 30 days of vertical component seismic data acquired within the Santa Fe River Sink‐Rise system (Sink‐Rise System), using power spectral density estimates and frequency‐wavenumber analysis to identify any noise source biases. Empirical Green's functions were derived through phase cross‐correlations and phase‐weighted stacking. The functions allowed extraction of group velocity dispersion measurements, which were inverted to generate 2D tomographic images at various periods. Tomographic images show multiple layers with varying group velocities that aligned with known hydrogeological features of the FAS, including its base, low‐porosity and low‐permeability dolostone semiconfining units characterized by elevated velocities, and zones of elevated porosity from karstification with reduced seismic velocities. Our results show how ambient seismic noise can be used to evaluate aquifer physical properties, identify unknown features, and identify the location and continuity of aquifer units.",

      "abstract": "Several tailings dam failures have been reported over the past few decades, raising questions about the stability of these structures. Over the past 30 years, there have been more severe failures of tailings dams, which have resulted in damage to the environment, fatalities and severe socio-economic issues. It is often impossible to predict when tailings dams could fail, so there is an urgent need to develop cost-effective methods for monitoring their stability and preventing such catastrophic events. Recent advancements in techniques related to ambient seismic noise have the potential to introduce new approaches to subsurface imaging and monitoring. In this study, we investigated the potential of using ambient seismic noise to monitor the interior wall of a tailings dam. We used 20 3C short-period geophones to record ambient noise over 3 days continuously. We set up the geophones at the Harmony Gold Mine tailings dam in Welkom, South Africa, along a survey profile approximately 100 m long. Seismic interferometry was used from the recorded data to retrieve empirical Green’s functions. We computed the dispersion curves’ inversion to determine the dam wall’s shear wave velocity at different depths. The calculated shear wave velocity cross-sections revealed a region of reduced velocity within the dam wall, situated between 2 m and 10 m beneath the surface. This zone of low velocity can be a sign of water-saturated material or other subsurface anomalies, which might jeopardise the dam’s structure.",

      "abstract": "\n We estimate changes in the seismic velocity (dv/v) from 25 years of ambient seismic noise recorded at Mount St. Helens (MSH). At MSH, the availability of seismic stations changes frequently due to station failure and the installation of new stations. Therefore, it is difficult to combine relative measurements that do not span the same time and space. We tackle this challenge by developing a spatial imaging algorithm to normalize all ∼1400 dv/v time series onto one spatial grid. Thereby, we obtain time-dependent velocity change maps of the MSH region, which we analyze with the help of auxiliary observations, such as ground position (i.e., Global Navigation Satellite System [GNSS]), weather data, environmental observations, and regional seismicity. In the dv/v time series, we find a variety of dynamics caused by volcanic, tectonic, and environmental forcing. With the initiation of MSH’s 2004–2008 volcanic crisis, dv/v exhibits a significant increase, which we link to the deflation of the volcanic plumbing system, also observed on GNSS data. Between 2013 and 2018, when seismicity levels are elevated, we find lower velocities at depth. This phase is followed by an episode of relative quiescence, accompanied by significant dv/v increases close to the St. Helens seismic zone. We suggest a reinflation of the magmatic plumbing system after MSH’s 2004–2008 eruption lasting until about 2017. Afterward, the magmatic activity in the subsurface reduces, thereby decreasing pressure and increasing the seismic velocity. Fluctuating groundwater levels may dominate the seasonal cycles in the dv/v time series. A contrasting seasonal response between the high-elevation edifice and foothill valleys may indicate that surface freezing inhibits subsurface groundwater infiltration at higher altitudes.",
      "summary": "This study investigates factors influencing seismic velocity at Mount St. Helens using twenty-five years of seismic data. A spatial imaging algorithm was developed to address challenges arising from changing seismic station availability. The research identified temporal changes in velocity related to volcanic, tectonic, and environmental factors. Findings suggest that seismic velocity changes correlate with volcanic activity, seismicity levels, and groundwater fluctuations in the region.",

Based on measurements with the Swiss plate geophone system with a 1 min temporal resolution, bedload transport fluctuations were analysed as a function of the flow and transport conditions in the Swiss Erlenbach stream. The study confirms a finding from an earlier event-based analysis of the same bedload transport data, which showed that the disequilibrium ratio of measured to calculated transport rate (disequilibrium condition) influences the sediment transport behaviour. To analyse the transport conditions, the following elements were examined to characterise bedload transport fluctuations: (i) the autocorrelation coefficient of bedload transport rates as a function of lag time (memory effect), (ii) the critical discharge at the start and end of a transport event, (iii) the variability in the bedload transport rates, and (iv) a hysteresis index as a measure of the strength of bedload transport during the rising and falling limb of the hydrograph. This study underlines that above-average disequilibrium conditions, which are associated with a larger sediment availability on the streambed, generally have a stronger effect on subsequent transport conditions than below-average disequilibrium conditions, which are associated with comparatively less sediment availability on the streambed. The findings highlight the important roles of the sediment availability on the streambed, the disequilibrium ratio, and the hydraulic forcing in view of a better understanding of the bedload transport fluctuations in a steep mountain stream.\n",

      "abstract": "Seismic instruments placed outside of spatially extensive hazard zones can be used to rapidly sense a range of mass movements. However, it remains challenging to automatically detect specific events of interest. Benford's law, which states that the first non‐zero digit of given data sets follows a specific probability distribution, can provide a computationally cheap approach to identifying anomalies in large data sets and potentially be used for event detection. Here, we select vertical component seismograms to derive the first digit distribution. The seismic signals generated by debris flows follow Benford's law, while those generated by ambient noise do not. We propose the physical and mathematical explanations for the occurrence of Benford's law in debris flows. Our finding of limited seismic data from landslides, lahars, bedload transports, and glacial lake outburst floods indicates that these events may follow Benford's Law, whereas rockfalls do not. Focusing on debris flows in the Illgraben, Switzerland, our Benford's law‐based detector is comparable to an existing random forest model that was trained on 70 features and six seismic stations. Achieving a similar result based on Benford's law requires only 12 features and single station data. We suggest that Benford's law is a computationally cheap, novel technique that offers an alternative for event recognition and potentially for real‐time warnings.",

      "abstract": "This study analyses the ambient noise field recorded by the seismic network, TREMBLE, in Bangladesh, operational since late 2016. Horizontal-vertical spectral ratios confirm the placement of stations on sediment, many situated on thick sedimentary columns, consistent with local geology. Noise across the broadband spectrum is systematically examined. A high amplitude local microseism (0.4–0.8 Hz) is recorded, originating near the coast and modulated by local tides. The secondary microseism (0.15–0.35 Hz) correlates strongly with wave height in the Bay of Bengal and varies with seasons, with greater power and higher horizontal amplitude in the monsoon season when the wave height is highest. The microseism increases in amplitude and decreases in frequency as a tropical depression moves inland. The primary microseism (∼0.07–0.08 Hz) exhibits no seasonal changes in power but display strong horizontal energy which changes with seasons. Low frequency (0.02–0.04 Hz) noise on the horizontal components has a 24-h periodicity, due to instrument tilt caused by atmospheric pressure changes. A station located next to the major Karnaphuli River shows elevated energy at ∼5 Hz correlated to periods of high rainfall. Anthropogenic noise (∼4–14 Hz) is station-dependent, demonstrating changing patterns in human activity, such as during Ramadan, national holidays and the COVID pandemic. Our work holds implications for seismic deployments, earthquake, and imaging studies, while providing insights into the interaction between the atmosphere, ocean, and solid Earth.",

However, the understanding of the sediment‐transport mechanisms that control these processes remains incomplete due to the lack of effective monitoring methods. In this study, we utilize seismic data captured during these sediment‐laden flows through field experiments and in situ monitoring to offer insights into flow mechanics and sediment transport mechanisms. Results show that sediment transport in stream flows and hyperconcentrated flows is primarily supported by viscous shear and turbulent stresses, whereas grain collisional stresses play a significant role in debris‐flow dynamics. By characterizing impact rates, basal impulses and flow discharge, seismic monitoring can reveal the internal flow dynamics and bulk flow characteristics as well as the characteristics of sediment transport. Increasing solid concentrations can elicit positive nonlinearities in the frequency‐based scaling relationships between seismic power and hydrographs, indicating transitions in the seismic signal from turbulence‐bedload‐dominated to bedload‐dominated, and grain collisional‐dominated regimes. By introducing the ratio of the real shear stress to the critical shear stress, we refined the phase space for sediment stability. Combining this criterion with the absolute seismic power enables us to establish ground‐motion thresholds for distinguishing different flow types. Our results highlight opportunities to use seismic data for the quantitative inversion of these fluvial processes and debris flows as well as early warning strategies.",

      "abstract": "Passive seismic monitoring (PSM) is emerging as a tool for detecting rockfall events and pre‐failure seismicity. In this paper, the potential of PSM for rockfall monitoring is assessed through a case study carried out in Gros‐Morne, Eastern Québec, in a region with prominent roadside cliffs, where more than 500 fallen rocks are found on the main regional road each year. The proposed method relies on using sensitive STA‐LTA windows to detect a very large number of seismic events and build a comprehensive catalog. In total, more than 70,000 seismic events were detected over one year. Gaussian mixtures are used to partition the data set. Based on visual inspection of the data, a main working hypothesis is that the seismic events can be clustered into three groups. After analyzing the spatio‐temporal distribution of the events in each group, we find that the events of one cluster can be associated with anthropogenic activity. The frequency of occurrence of the events of the different clusters and their link with meteorological data is also examined through a regression exercise, to assess the importance of the meteorological variables as explanatory variables. The results allow us to postulate on the physical origins of the signals in the different clusters, attributing them to rockfall activity and wind‐induced seismic noise.",

Recent advances in geophysical methods provide new opportunities for accurate groundwater assessment. Seismic wave speed data, sensitive to changes in pore water pressure, can be used in a passive monitoring approach, while electrical conductivity data can be used for monitoring SMC. Combining seismic and electromagnetic induction (EMI)-based monitoring techniques enhances our understanding of groundwater dynamics. Seismic methods enable wide spatial coverage with moderate depth resolution, whereas EMI offers high-resolution, rapid data acquisition, particularly effective for shallow subsurface monitoring. Integrating these approaches can leverage the strengths of each, yielding comprehensive, high-resolution insights into dynamic subsurface hydrological processes. Integrating these approaches allows for improved groundwater monitoring, aiding in better understanding and managing droughts in regions like the Netherlands.",

      "abstract": "Crustal perturbations related to seismic activity can generally be observed with the occurrence of a large magnitude event. For less energetic seismic sequences though, the associated transient crustal variations are questionably measurable, and their observation gets easily obscured by relatively stronger perturbations such as the ones related to hydrological processes. In this study we reveal the significant role that terrestrial water‐storage variations play in governing temporal crustal changes in the tectonically active Northern Apennines of Italy, and discuss the potential of accounting for its correction in order to monitor the relatively weaker transient perturbations caused by local seismic swarms. This area is characterized by an extensive level of low‐energetic seismic activity, typically clustered in time and space, of which three main seismic swarms outstand during the 12 year period of study (2010–2021). Our analysis compares independent observations and processing methods of Global Navigation Satellite System measurements and ambient seismic noise recordings. We adopt a multivariate statistical approach to discriminate between independent sources of ground deformation, and seismic noise cross‐correlation analysis to monitor relative seismic‐velocity variations. The result shows how the perturbation effects produced by variations in total water content are dominant in both time series of ground deformations and seismic‐velocity variations. After correcting for the water‐related variation effects, our monitoring results reveal perturbations in the crustal properties whose activation time and depth range correlate with the occurrences of the seismic swarms.",

      "abstract": "Lahars, or volcanic mudflows, are one of the most devastating natural, volcanic hazards. Deadly lahars, such as the one that occurred after the Nevado del Ruiz, Columbia eruption in 1985, in which at least 23,000 people tragically lost their lives, threaten the safety and well-being of humans, the economy, and the infrastructure of many of the communities living in the vicinity of volcanoes. Due to their complex flow behaviors, lahars remain a major challenge to those studying them. We present an analysis of several rain-triggered lahar events at Volcán Fuego in Guatemala using both seismic and infrasound monitoring to quantify both ground vibrations and low-frequency atmospheric sound waves associated with these mudflows. Geophysical data collected over this field campaign quantifies flow parameters such as velocities, stage and the frequency of these rain-triggered lahars. Time-lapse imagery of lahar flows is compared with filtered seismo-acoustic signal characteristics to ascertain stage predictions and relationship to stage fluxes. Using random forest regression models, we establish moderate correlations (correlation coefficient modes 0.48–0.53) with statistical significance (p value = 0.01–0.02) between signal energetics and respective stage. Compiling a catalog of rain-triggered lahar events in Volcán de Fuego’s drainages over a season permits a dataset amenable to statistical analysis. Our goal is the development of new-generation geophysical monitoring tools that will be capable of remote and real-time estimation of flow parameters.",

      "abstract": "\n An increase in seismic activity precedes most volcanic eruptions. Whereas event-based forecasting approaches have been successful, some eruptions remain unanticipated, resulting in casualties and damage. Our study leverages the recent advancements in ambient field seismology. We explore features extracted from continuous ambient fields using traditional methods, for example, peak ground velocity, peak ground acceleration, root mean square, root median square, real-time seismic amplitude measurement, and novel methods (displacement seismic amplitude ratio and spectral width). In addition, we explore unsupervised learning of higher order wavelet features using scattering networks. We find that combining all the methods was necessary to disentangle the effects of seismic sources from structural changes at Mount St. Helens. Although the ambient wavefield-based approach does not yield additional or more significant precursory signals than event-based methods at Mount St. Helens, our study demonstrates that the ambient wavefield provides supplementary information, mainly about structural changes and complements traditional methods. The ambient seismic wavefield offers additional insights into long-lasting processes. We find enhanced wave attenuation correlating with geochemical measurements. We interpret this as ongoing structural changes, such as dome growth or the evolution of the volcanic conduit system. On annual and decadal timescales, we interpret seasonal seismic attenuation in the shallow subsurface as groundwater fluctuations, corroborated by observations at the nearby Spirit Lake level. This multimethod approach at Mount St. Helens sheds light on a volcanic system’s underlying dynamics and structure.",

Landquakes generated by rockfalls are regarded as good proxies for those properties. To explore the free‐fall impact dynamics of rockfalls, a series of free‐fall experiments on granular masses were designed and conducted with the characteristics of the generated landquakes versus initial variables being analyzed. The results show that the particle diameter is a dominant factor affecting landquakes, with the most significant effect on the mean frequency. The impact area is another key factor, with which both the maximum seismic amplitude and radiated seismic energy have strong positive correlations, while the mean frequency of landquakes shows a weak negative correlation. The maximum seismic amplitude appears to have a poor correlation with the numbers of layers of the free‐falling granular masses, and it was proven that the maximum seismic amplitude is determined by only the lower part of the granular masses. Quantitative relationships between the number of particles and seismic signal characteristics indicate that disintegration needs to be accounted for when landquakes are used to investigate the characteristics of a rockfall. Moreover, the frequency of landquakes decreases with a decrease in the vertical velocity and increase in the horizontal velocity during granular mass collapse.",

      "abstract": "Cryospheric responses to climate warming include glacier retreat, altitude‐dependent thermal instability, and abundant meltwater, which increase the frequency of catastrophic glacier hazard chain (CGHC) events. Here we investigated the formation mechanism of a special CGHC event in 2018, in the Sedongpu Glacier, Eastern Himalayas, China. Based on the multi‐source remote sensing, seismic signal analysis, and numerical simulation, we conducted long‐term retrospective analysis and co‐event process reconstruction. The results show that the event could be divided into two phases. First, the hanging glacier with a volume of 8.5 × 106 m3 collapsed onto the downstream trunk glacier. Next, ∼1.17 × 108 m3 eroded materials from the impacted glacier transformed into debris flow and traveled downstream 8 km. During the cascading process, ice‐rock avalanche momentum and glacier velocity are key factors in determining CGHC formation and eventual volume. Our study helps better understand the domino effects of the CGHC disaster.",

Researchers analyzed a specific CGHC event from 2018 at Sedongpu Glacier using remote sensing, seismic data, and numerical modeling.

      "abstract": "Abnormal changes in groundwater level are key indicators of seismic precursors. Before an earthquake, the groundwater level often shows varying degrees of abnormality. These anomalies typically manifest as a sudden rise or fall in groundwater levels and will last for a period of time. On Jul. 12, 2020, at 6:38 AM, a 5.1 magnitude earthquake occurred in Guye District, Tangshan City, Hebei Province, China (39.78°N, 118.44°E). This study uses this earthquake as a case study to analyze the groundwater level data from two observation wells, the Zhaogezhuang well and Yutian Ji 03 well. To accurately identify seismic precursor anomalies, the groundwater level data were divided into seismically active (SA) and seismically inactive (non-SA) periods, forming the basis for dataset segmentation. This paper proposes a TCN-LSTM-Attention model that combines the advantages of effective feature extraction with TCN and capturing complex temporal dependencies with LSTM. Experiments show that the designed model has strong abilities in predicting groundwater levels and identifying earthquake precursor anomalies. To enhance the accuracy of anomaly detection, this study employed an Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA) control chart to precisely pinpoint the onset of anomalies. Through validation with earthquakes in Jianshui County, Yunnan Province, China, the model effectively identified groundwater level anomalies under different geological conditions, confirming its generalization and practicality. Finally, this article conducted cross validation on the designed model, which has improved its reliability in practical applications. This study has certain scientific innovation and practical value in earthquake precursor analysis, providing new technical support and analysis methods for the development of earthquake warning technology and disaster prevention and reduction work.",

      "abstract": "While geodetic measurements have long been used to assess landslides, seismic methods are increasingly recognized as valuable tools for providing additional insights into subsurface structures and mechanisms. This work aims to characterize the subsurface structures of the deep-seated gravitational slope deformation (DSGSD) at Heinzenberg through the integration of active and passive seismic measurements. Seismic techniques can hereby deliver additional information on the subsurface structure and mechanisms involved, e.g., the degree of rock mass degradation, the resonant frequencies of the potentially unstable compartments, and the local fracture network orientations that are influenced by wavefield polarization. By employing advanced methods such as H/V analysis, site-to-reference spectral ratios, polarization analysis, surface wave analysis, and the joint multizonal transdimensional Bayesian inversion of velocity structures, we establish a comprehensive baseline model of the landslide at five selected sites. This baseline model shall help identify potential changes after the refilling of Lake Lüsch, which started in 2021. Our results reveal the rupture surface of the DSGSD at various depths ranging from 30 m at the top to over 90 m in the middle of the slope. Additionally, we estimate key parameters including the shear wave velocities of the different rock masses. The 2D geophysical profiles and rock mass properties contribute to the understanding of the subsurface geometry, geomechanical properties, and potential water pathways. This study demonstrates the significance of integrating seismic methods with traditional geodetic measurements and geomorphologic analysis techniques for a comprehensive assessment of landslides, enhancing our ability to monitor and mitigate hazardous events.",

This study aims to identify water‐filled subglacial reservoirs from ambient seismic noise collected by moderate‐cost surveys. The horizontal‐to‐vertical spectral ratio technique is highly sensitive to impedance contrasts at interfaces, thus commonly used to estimate glacier thickness. Here, we focus on the inverse ratio, that is, the V/H spectral ratio (VHSR), whose high values indicate a low impedance volume beneath the surface, suggesting subglacial cavities. We analyze VHSR peaks from a seismic array of 60 nodes installed on the Tête‐Rousse Glacier (Mont Blanc massif, French Alps); data were gathered over 15 days. Mapping the VHSR amplitude over the free surface reveals the main cavity locations and the basal areas affected by melting within the glacier.

      "abstract": "Abstract. Understanding the dynamics of slope instabilities is critical to mitigate the associated hazards, but their direct observation is often difficult due to their remote locations and their spontaneous nature. Seismology allows us to get unique information on these events, including on their dynamics. However, the link between the properties of these events (mass and kinematics) and the seismic signals generated is still poorly understood. We conducted a controlled rockfall experiment in the Riou Bourdoux torrent (southern French Alps) to try to better decipher those links. We deployed a dense seismic network and inferred the dynamics of the block from the reconstruction of the 3D trajectory from terrestrial and airborne high-resolution stereophotogrammetry. We propose a new approach based on machine learning to predict the mass and the velocity of each block. Our results show that we can predict those quantities with average errors of approximately 10 % for the velocity and 25 % for the mass. These accuracies are as good as or better than those obtained by other approaches, but our approach has the advantage in that it does not require the source to be localised, nor does it require a high-resolution velocity model or a strong assumption on the seismic wave attenuation model. Finally, the machine learning approach allows us to explore more widely the correlations between the features of the seismic signal generated by the rockfalls and their physical properties, and it might eventually lead to better constraints on the physical models in the future.\n",

      "abstract": "Abstract. The flow of glaciers is largely controlled by changes at the ice–bed interface, where basal slip and sediment deformation drive basal glacier motion. Determining subglacial conditions and their responses to hydraulic forcing remains challenging due to the difficulty of accessing the glacier bed. Here, we monitor the interplay between surface runoff and hydro-mechanical conditions at the base of the Kongsvegen glacier in Svalbard. From July 2021 to August 2022, we measured both subglacial water pressure and till strength. Additionally, we derived median values of subglacial hydraulic gradient and radius of channelized subglacial drainage system from seismic power, recorded at the glacier surface. To characterize the variations in the subglacial conditions caused by changes in surface runoff, we investigate the variations of the following hydro-mechanical properties: measured water pressure, measured sediment ploughing forces, and derived hydraulic gradient and radius, over seasonal, multi-day, and diurnal timescales. We discuss our results in light of existing theories of subglacial hydrology and till mechanics to describe subglacial conditions. We find that during the short, low-melt-rate season in 2021, the subglacial drainage system evolved at equilibrium with runoff, increasing its capacity as the melt season progressed. In contrast, during the long and high-melt-rate season in 2022, the subglacial drainage system evolved transiently to respond to the abrupt and large water supply. We suggest that in the latter configuration, the drainage capacity of the preferential drainage axis was exceeded, promoting the expansion of hydraulically connected regions and local weakening of ice–bed coupling and, hence, enhanced sliding.\n",

Researchers monitored subglacial water pressure and till strength, also deriving hydraulic gradient and drainage system radius from seismic data. They analyzed variations in these hydro-mechanical properties across different timescales to understand the impact of surface runoff changes. The study suggests that the subglacial drainage system's response to runoff differs between low-melt and high-melt seasons, potentially impacting ice-bed coupling and glacier sliding.",

In the laboratory, pre-seismic reductions in seismic velocity indicate that asperity contacts within the fault zone begin to fail before the macroscopic frictional sliding. The recognition of such effects in natural seismic-cycles has been challenging. Here we exploit seasonal hydrological strains, performing a natural analogue to a quasi-static laboratory pump-probe experiment to investigate the nonlinear strain sensitivity of crustal rocks and its role in seismic failure along the tectonically-active Irpinia Fault System (Southern Italy). By comparing 14-years-long series of spring discharge, strain, seismic velocity variations and earthquakes rate, we find that seismicity peaks during maximum hydrological forcing and minimum seismic velocity. Seasonal strains of ~10−6 are required for both earthquake triggering and significant nonlinearity effects arising from modulus reduction. We suggest that, for faults in a critical state, cyclical softening may lead to failure and seasonal seismicity. Through the exploitation of a seasonal hydrological deformation to probe the elastic properties of the crust, the authors here explain variations of seismic waves velocity and triggering of earthquakes in terms of nonlinear elasticity.",
      "summary": "This study explores the connection between crustal elasticity and earthquake activity. The researchers used seasonal hydrological strains to examine the Irpinia Fault System in Southern Italy. They analyzed data on spring discharge, strain, seismic velocity, and earthquake rates over a 14-year period. The findings suggest that seasonal hydrological forcing and modulus reduction could trigger earthquakes on critically stressed faults.",

      "abstract": "The Antarctic ice sheet is buttressed by floating ice shelves that calve icebergs along large fractures called rifts. Despite the significant influence exerted by rifting on ice shelf geometry and buttressing, the scarcity of in situ observations of rift propagation contributes considerable uncertainty to understanding rift dynamics. Here, we report the first‐ever seismic recording of a multiple‐kilometer rift propagation event. Remote sensing and seismic recordings reveal that a rift in the Pine Island Glacier Ice Shelf extended 10.53 km at a speed of 35.1 m/s, the fastest known ice fracture at this scale. We simulate ocean‐coupled rift propagation and find that the dynamics of water flow within the rift limit the propagation rate, resulting in rupture two orders of magnitude slower than typically predicted for brittle fracture. Using seismic recordings of the elastic waves generated during rift propagation, we estimate that ocean water flows into the rift at a rate of at least 2,300 m3/s during rift propagation and causes mixing in the subshelf cavity. Our observations support the hypotheses that large ice shelf rift propagation events are brittle, hydrodynamically limited, and exhibit sensitive coupling with the surrounding ocean.",

      "abstract": "Abstract. Recent studies have shown that hydrophone sensors can monitor bedload flux in rivers by measuring the self-generated noise (SGN) emitted by bedload particles when they impact the riverbed. However, experimental and theoretical studies have shown that the measured SGN depends not only on bedload flux intensity but also the propagation environment, which differs between rivers. Moreover, the SGN can propagate far from the acoustic source and be well measured at distant river positions without bedload transport. It has been shown that this dependency of the measured SGN data on the propagation environment can significantly affect the performance of monitoring bedload flux by hydrophone techniques. In this article, we propose an inversion model to solve the problem of the SGN propagation and integration effect. In this model, we assume that the riverbed acts as SGN source areas with intensity proportional to the local bedload flux. The inversion model locates the SGN sources and calculates their corresponding acoustic power by solving a system of linear algebraic equations, accounting for the actual measured cross-sectional acoustic power (acoustic mapping) and attenuation properties. We tested the model using data from measured bedload SGN profiles (acoustic mapping with a drift boat) and bedload flux profiles (direct sampling with an Elwha sampler) acquired during two field campaigns conducted in 2018 and 2021 on the Giffre river in the French Alps. Results confirm that the bedload flux measured at different verticals on the river cross-section correlates more with the inversed acoustic power than measured acoustic power. Moreover, it was possible to fit data from the two field campaigns with a common curve after inversion, which was not possible with the measured acoustic data. The results of the inversion model, compared to measured data, show the importance of considering the propagation effect when using the hydrophone technique and offer new perspectives for the calibration of bedload flux with SGN in rivers.\n",

An inversion model is proposed to address the problem of self-generated noise propagation and integration. The model locates noise sources and calculates acoustic power by solving linear equations.

      "abstract": "Prompt detection of landslides is crucial for reducing the disaster risk and preventing landslides. However, landslide detection in practical applications still faces many challenges, such as the complexity of environmental backgrounds, the diversity of target scales, and the enormity of model weights. To address these issues, this paper proposes a lightweight LBE-YOLO model for real-time landslide detection. Firstly, a lightweight model is designed by integrating the GhostConv lightweight network with the YOLOv8n model. Inspired by GhostConv, this study innovatively designed the GhostC2f structure, which leverages linear thinking to further reduce the model parameters and computational burden. Additionally, the newly designed EGC2f structure, incorporating an attention mechanism, not only maintains the model’s lightweight characteristics but also enhances the network’s capability to extract valid information. Subsequently, the Path Aggregation Network (PAN) was optimized by introducing a bidirectional feature propagation mechanism to improve the model’s feature fusion ability. Additionally, the Bijie landslide dataset was expanded through data augmentation strategies, thereby further improving the model’s generalization capability. The experimental results indicate that, compared to the YOLOv8n model, the proposed model increased accuracy by 4.2%, while the model’s weight and computational load were reduced by 32.0% and 35.5%, respectively. This verifies the superiority of the LBE-YOLO model in landslide target detection, which will help mitigate the impacts of natural disasters.",

      "abstract": "Extreme floods are known to severely reorganise inhabited landscapes by inundation, clogging, scouring and damaging infrastructure and lives. However, their post-event impacts are poorly understood, especially concerning coupled hillslope channel feedbacks such as the reactivation of slope instabilities connected to the river and that may be able to block it upon sudden failure. The July 2021 Ahr valley flood exemplified this ability of concurrent and sustained landscape reorganisation. Here, we study a retrogressive slope instability near the town of Müsch, in the upper Ahr valley using field mapping, repeat airborne laser scanning, electrical resistivity tomography and passive seismic monitoring to reveal the failure geometry, its mechanisms and transient activity. The old landslide developed in lower Devonian rocks. It is 100 m wide, 200 m long and approximately 15–20 m deep, which leads to a total volume of about 430,000 m3. This landslide was severely undercut by the 2021 flood with 7000 m3 of material eroded at the landslide toe. The landslide has started to react. Given the narrow section of the river at this location, there is a potential landslide dam hazard. We modelled the inundation volumes and back fill times for different failure scenarios, ranging between 20,000 m3 and 330,000 m3 accumulating within 5 min and 20 h. Our results imply a need to systematically screen flood impacted landscapes for sustained post-event hillslope activity that governs hillslope-channel coupling, driving both persistent sediment injection into the stream and sudden river blocking and subsequent damming.",

      "abstract": "\n The U.S. Geological Survey Cascades Volcano Observatory (CVO) recently expanded its continuous geophysical monitoring at Mount Rainier, an active stratovolcano in Washington state. CVO monitors volcanoes in Oregon, Washington, and Idaho to characterize volcanic systems and detect unrest. Mount Rainier has a history of large lahar occurrences in the Holocene, including at least one that may not have been associated with volcanic activity. Pierce County, Washington, is one of the areas most at risk from large lahars. In the 1990s, CVO collaborated with Pierce County to install the Rainier lahar detection system (RLDS), an automated system designed to detect large lahars in high-risk drainages and mitigate hazards to heavily populated areas. The system was designed to detect lahars within 5–10 min of their occurrence and alert authorities of the need to evacuate populated low-lying areas before lahar arrival. In addition, CVO and the Pacific Northwest Seismic Network (PNSN) maintained and expanded a network of seismic and geodetic monitoring stations on and near the edifice to provide adequate volcano monitoring capabilities. Since 2016, CVO has worked to upgrade the existing RLDS and to expand its capabilities into other drainages around Mount Rainier. This expansion includes installation of 25 new broadband seismic stations with many including infrasound along high-risk drainages, as well as support for equipment upgrades at existing PNSN and CVO volcano monitoring sites. All stations transmit continuous, near-real-time data with dramatically improved spatial coverage for volcano monitoring and lahar hazard mitigation compared to the previous system.",

      "abstract": "Understanding volcanic eruption triggers is critical toward anticipating future activity. While internal magma dynamics typically receive more attention, the influence of external processes remains less understood. In this context, we explore the relationship between seasonal snow cycles and eruptive activity at Ruapehu, New Zealand. This is motivated by apparent seasonality in the eruptive record, where a higher than expected proportion of eruptions (post‐1960) occur in spring (including the two previous eruptions of 2006 and 2007). Employing recent advancements in passive seismic interferometry, we compute sub‐surface seismic velocity changes between 2005 and 2009 using the cross‐wavelet transform approach. Stations on the volcano record a higher velocity in winter, closely correlated with the presence of snow. Inverting for depth suggests these changes occur within the upper 300 m. Notably, we observe that the timing of the previous two eruptions coincides with a period associated with an earlier velocity decrease at approximately 200–300 m depth relative to the surface. Reduced water infiltration (as precipitation falls as snow) is considered a likely control of seasonal velocities, while modeling also points to a contribution from snow‐loading. We hypothesize that this latter process may play a role toward explaining seasonality in the eruptive record. Our findings shed light on the complex interactions between volcanoes and external environmental processes, highlighting the need for more focused research in this area. Pursuing this line of inquiry has significant implications toward improved risk and hazard assessments at not just Ruapehu, but also other volcanoes globally that experience seasonal snow cover.",

We present an application of the Tsai et al. (2012, https://doi.org/10.1029/2011gl050255) bedload seismic model to an ephemeral channel located in the semi‐arid southwestern US and incorporate modifications to better estimate bedload flux in this environment. To test the model, we collected streambank seismic signals and directly measured bedload flux during four flash‐floods. Bedload predictions calculated by inversion from the Tsai model underestimated bedload flux observations by one‐to‐two orders of magnitude at low stages. However, model predictions were better for moderate flow depths (>50 cm), where saltation is expected to dominate bedload transport. We explored three differences between the model assumptions and our field conditions: (a) rolling and sliding particles have different impact frequencies than saltating particles; (b) the velocity and angle of impact of rolling particles onto the riverbed differ; and (c) the fine‐grained alluvial character of this and similar riverbeds leads to inelastic impacts, as opposed to the originally conceptualized elastic impacts onto rigid bedrock. We modified the original model to assume inelastic bed impacts and to incorporate rolling and sliding by adjusting the statistical distributions of bedload impact frequency, velocity, and angle. Our modified “multiple‐transport‐mode bedload seismic model” decreased error relative to observations to less than one order of magnitude across all measured flow conditions. Further investigations in other environmental settings are required to demonstrate the robustness and general applicability of the model.",

      "abstract": "The observation of precursory signals of the 2021 Chamoli rock–ice avalanche provides an opportunity to investigate the multidisciplinary analysis approach of rock failure. On 7 February 2021, a huge rock–ice mass detached from the Raunthi peak at Chamoli district in Uttarakhand, India. The tragic catastrophe resulted in more than 200 deaths and significant economic losses. Here, we analyse radon concentration and seismic signals to characterise the potential precursory anomalies prior to the detachment. Continuous peaks of radon anomalies were observed from the afternoon of 5 to 7 February and decreased suddenly after the event, while a cumulative number of seismic tremors and amplitude variations are more intensified ~2.30 h before the main event, indicating a static to dynamic phase change within the weak zone. This study not only characterises abnormal signals but also models the rock failure mechanisms. The analysis unveils three time‐dependent nucleation phases, physical mechanisms of signal generation and a complete scenario of physical factors that affected the degree of criticality of slope failure. The results of this study suggest gradual progression of rock cracks/joints, subsequent material creep and slip advancement acceleration preceded the final failure. Furthermore, the study highlights the importance of an early warning system to mitigate the impact of events like the 2021 Chamoli rock–ice avalanche.",

We estimate the seismic attenuation of P and S waves in the polar firn and underlying ice by spectral analysis of diving, refracted, and reflected waves from active-source three-component seismic signals obtained in 2010 on the Whillans Ice Stream (WIS), a fast-flowing ice stream in West Antarctica. The resulting quality factors are then successfully modeled using a rock-physics theory of wave propagation that combines White's mesoscopic attenuation theory of interlayer flow with that of Biot/squirt flow. The first theory describes an equivalent viscoelastic medium consisting of a stack of two alternating thin porous layers, both of which have thicknesses that are much greater than the pore size but smaller than the wavelength. On the other hand, in the so-called Biot/squirt-flow model, there are two loss mechanisms, namely the global Biot flow and the local flow from fluid-filled microcracks (or grain contacts) to the pore space and back, where the former is dominant over the latter. The fluid saturating the pores is assumed to be fluidized snow, defined as a mixture of snow particles and air, such as powder, with a rigidity modulus of zero.\n",

The volcano has been monitored by a network of permanent, short period and broadband seismometers. I used the continuous waveform data from that network starting in 2012 to generate a catalog of seismicity that enhances the US Geological Survey Hawaiian Volcano Observatory’s public seismic catalog with four times the number of earthquakes, which were then grouped by waveform similarity. Analysis of subtle delays in the timing of arrivals of scattered waves between pairs of earthquakes in this catalog yields a history of small changes in the shallow seismic velocity structure of the volcano. Seismic velocities have been shown at other volcanoes to change during unrest and eruption. My results show a decrease in seismic velocity centered on the summit beginning in September 2022, corresponding to the onset of a vigorous precursory swarm of seismic activity and shallow inflation. During the eruption itself, I observe large changes due likely to dike opening along the northeast rift zone and deflation of the summit reservoir. However, seismic velocity changes associated with non-volcanic sources such as ground shaking from large earthquakes and meteorological influences at seasonal and diurnal time scales are also observed, and these dominate the velocity changes prior to the eruption. Proper accounting of these effects will be a requirement for use in real-time monitoring, and this work serves as a starting point in that endeavor for Mauna Loa.",

Our study reveals a significant dynamic velocity reduction (∼0.2%), primarily due to near‐surface damage, with a permanent drop linked to documented landslides and subsidence observed immediately after the earthquake. We also identified a positive long‐term linear trend in velocity variations, indicative of a generalized contraction of the Ischia Caldera, as revealed by geodetic modeling.

      "abstract": "We calibrated an acoustic pipe microphone system to monitor bedload flux in a sandy, gravel‐bed ephemeral channel. Ours is a first attempt to test the limit of an acoustic surrogate bedload system in a channel with a high content of sand. Calibrations varied in quality; significant data subsetting was required to achieve R2 values >0.75. Several data quality issues had to be addressed: (1) apparent pulses, which occur when a sensor records an impulse from sediment impacting the surrounding substrate rather than directly impacting the sensor, were frequent, especially at higher signal amplifications. (2) The impact sensors were frequently covered by gravel sheets. This prompted the development of a cover detection protocol that rejected part of the impact sensor record when at least one sensor was partially or fully covered. (3) Because of the lack of sensor sensitivity to impacts of sand‐sized particles, which was anticipated, and the considerable sand component of bedload in this channel, a grain size‐limited bedload flux was estimated. This was accomplished by sampling the bedload captured by slot samplers and evaluating the variation of grain size with increasing flow strength. This considerably improved the results when compared to attempts at estimating the flux of the entire distribution of grain sizes. This calibration is a successful first attempt, though the impact sensors required several site‐specific calibration steps. A universal set of equations using impact sensors to estimate bedload transport of fine‐gravel with a large content of sand remains elusive. Notwithstanding, our study demonstrates the utility of impact sensor data, producing relatively low root mean square errors that are independent of measurements of flow strength (i.e. discharge). These tools will be particularly useful in settings that would benefit from new methodologies for estimating bedload transport in sand‐rich gravel‐bed rivers, such as the American desert Southwest.",

It can enable the detection of hidden processes such as brittle fracture, basal sliding, transient hydrological processes, and calving. Addressing the challenge of detecting signals from many different processes, we present a novel approach for the semi-automated detection of events and event-like noise, which is well-suited for use as Part 1 of a workflow where unsupervised machine learning will be used as Part 2 (Latto et al., 2024) to facilitate the main reconnaissance of diverse detected event types. Implemented in the open-source and widely used ObsPy Python package, the multi-STA/LTA algorithm constructs a hybrid characteristic function from a set of short-term average (sta)–long-term average (lta) pairs (refer to Sect. 2 in the main text for an explanation of how uppercase and lowercase STA/sta and LTA/lta abbreviations are differentiated). We apply the algorithm to data from a seismic array deployed on the Whillans Ice Stream (WIS) in West Antarctica (austral summer 2010–2011) to form a “catch-all” catalogue of events and event-like noise. The new algorithm compares favorably with standard approaches, yielding a diversity of seismic events, including all previously identified stick-slip events (Pratt et al., 2014), teleseisms, and other noise-type signals. In terms of a catalogue overview, we investigate a partial association of seismicity with the tidal cycle and a slight association with ice temperature changes of the Antarctic summer. The new algorithm and workflow will assist in the comparison of different glacier environments using seismology, the identification of process change over time, and the targeting of possible subsequent high-resolution studies.\n",

Given the high number and diversity of events in a typical cryoseismic dataset, in particular those recorded on ice sheet margins, it is desirable to use a semi-automated method of grouping similar events for reconnaissance and ongoing analysis. We present a workflow for employing semi-unsupervised cluster analysis to inform investigations of the processes occurring in glaciers and ice sheets. In this demonstration study, we make use of a seismic event catalogue previously compiled for the Whillans Ice Stream, for the 2010–2011 austral summer (outlined in Part 1, Latto et al., 2024). We address the challenges of seismic event analysis for a complex wave field by clustering similar seismic events into groups using characteristic temporal, spectral, and polarization attributes of seismic time series with the k-means++ algorithm. This provides the basis for a reconnaissance analysis of a seismic wave field that contains local events (from the ice stream) set in an ambient wave field that itself contains a diversity of signals (mostly from the Ross Ice Shelf). As one result, we find that two clusters include stick-slip events that diverge in terms of length and initiation locality (i.e., central sticky spot and/or the grounding line). We also identify a swarm of high-frequency signals on 16–17 January 2011 that are potentially associated with a surface melt event from the Ross Ice Shelf. Used together with the event detection presented in Part 1, the semi-automated workflow could readily be generalized to other locations and, as a possible benchmark procedure, could enable the monitoring of remote glaciers over time and comparisons between locations.\n",

Through array analyses, we identified two primary components. First, we observed far-field P waves dominating the 0.5–1.2 Hz frequency range, which are likely primarily generated by wind-driven oceanic swell activity. Second, we detected near-field body waves resulting from anthropogenic activities in the frequency range 2–8 Hz. We examined noise correlation functions derived from data of the dense deployment and regional stations to explore fault-zone seismic velocity changes using ballistic arrivals, with a focus on velocity perturbation shortly before and after the Ridgecrest earthquake sequence. Our findings exhibit distinct behavior compared to results obtained through standard coda-wave interferometry. Particularly, we observed a decrease in P-wave travel time on certain station pairs prior to the 2019 earthquake sequence. Supported by detailed investigation of the local seismic wavefields, we interpret the decreasing P-wave travel time as likely caused by a velocity increase away from the fault, possibly related to fluid migration. However, additional information is necessary to verify this hypothesis.",

      "abstract": "Passive surface wave exploration using urban high-frequency noise has been studied extensively. As the main noise source of the urban environment, vehicle noise can generate higher frequency surface waves, thus enhancing detection resolution. However, the existing methods usually hope to obtain more stable dispersion imaging results by collecting ambient noise for a longer period, resulting in high acquisition costs. To further enhance the efficiency of geological surveys, we propose a method that utilizes vehicle noise coda waves for geological investigations. We conducted numerical simulations of vehicle noise and proposed a method for calculating segment duration. We successfully captured the tail waves of vehicle noise and obtained high-quality surface wave signals through phase-weighted stacking (PWS). This method can obtain reliable dispersion curves by utilizing very short-duration vehicle noise. The vehicle noise from Jinan Metro Line R3 and Qingdao Metro Line 6 are collected, and data processing is conducted using the method proposed in this article. The results show that this method can obtain the underground dispersion curve using 10 s or even a few seconds of data, and has the advantages of higher mode surface waves being more developed and having strong resistance to interference noise. The validity and reliability of the proposed method were verified by comparing the results obtained using this method with those obtained from traditional methods and geological data. It provides a means for rapid and accurate on-site investigation by utilizing vehicle noise with ultra-short durations.",

Numerical simulations and field data from metro lines were used to test the method. The findings suggest that reliable dispersion curves can be obtained from very short duration noise data.",

      "abstract": "\n Unsupervised machine learning methods are gaining attention in the seismological community as more and larger datasets of continuous waveforms are collected. Recently, contrastive learning for unsupervised feature learning has shown great success in the field of computer vision and other domains, and we aim to transfer these methods to the domain of seismology. Contrastive learning algorithms use data augmentation to implement an instance-level discrimination task: The feature representations of two augmented versions of the same data example are trained to be similar, when at the same time dissimilar to other data examples. In particular, we use the popular contrastive learning method SimCLR. We test data augmentation strategies varying amplitude and frequency of seismological signals, and apply contrastive learning methods to automatically learn features. We use a dataset containing various mostly cryogenic waveforms detected by an STA/LTA short-term average/long-term average algorithm on continuous waveform recordings from the geophysical observatory at Neumayer station, Antarctica. The quality of the features is evaluated on a hand-labeled dataset that includes icequakes, earthquakes, and spikes, and on a larger unlabeled dataset using a classical clustering method, k-means. Results show that the approach separates the different hand-labeled groups with an accuracy of up to 88% and separates meaningful groups within the unlabeled data. Thus, we provide an effective tool for the unsupervised exploration of large seismological datasets and the automated compilation of event catalogs.",

There is growing evidence that proglacial discharge may be observed by listening to the glacier terminus using sophisticated tools, such as the micro‐barometer arrays that are used for nuclear‐test monitoring and the fiber‐optic technologies that are becoming increasingly used in geophysics. However, the prohibitive cost, instrumental complexity, overwhelming data volumes, and computational demands of these approaches mean that only the wealthiest countries can afford such technologies. We employ an intentionally inexpensive approach to monitor proglacial discharge by recording the audible sound that is generated near the glacier terminus, and we show that a simple microphone can tell us how much water is discharged by a glacier. This study demonstrates that sound can provide essential information on runoff and therefore contribute to environmental assessments of glaciers and disaster risk reduction of glacial flood events.",

      "abstract": "The way Alpine rivers mobilize, convey and store coarse material during high‐magnitude events is poorly understood, notably because it is difficult to obtain measurements of bedload transport at the watershed scale. Seismic sensor data, evaluated with appropriate seismic physical models, can provide that missing link by yielding time‐varying estimates of bedload transport albeit with non‐negligible uncertainty. Low cost and ease of installation allow for networks of sensors to be deployed, providing continuous, watershed‐scale insights into bedload transport dynamics. Here, we deploy a network of 24 seismic sensors to estimate coarse material fluxes in a 13.4 km2 Alpine watershed during a high‐magnitude transport event. First, we benchmark the seismic inversion routine with an independent time‐series of bedload transport obtained with a calibrated acoustic system. Then, we apply the procedure to the other seismic sensors across the watershed. Propagation velocities derived from cross‐correlation analysis between spatially consecutive bedload transport time‐series were too high with respect to typical bedload transport velocity suggesting that a faster‐moving water wave (re‐)mobilizes local coarse material. Spatially distributed estimates of bedload transport reveal a relative inefficiency of Alpine watersheds in evacuating coarse material, even during a relatively infrequent high‐magnitude bedload transport event. Significant inputs estimated for some tributaries were rapidly attenuated as the main river crossed less hydraulically efficient reaches. Only a small proportion of the total amount of material mobilized in the watershed was exported at the outlet. Multiple periods of competent flows are likely necessary to evacuate coarse material mobilized throughout the watershed during individual bedload transport events.",

      "abstract": "Abstract. Seismicity at glaciers, ice sheets, and ice shelves provides observational constraint on a number of glaciological processes. Detecting and locating this seismicity, specifically icequakes, is a necessary first step in studying processes such as basal slip, crevassing, imaging ice fabric, and iceberg calving, for example. Most glacier deployments to date use conventional seismic networks, comprised of seismometers distributed over the entire area of interest. However, smaller-aperture seismic arrays can also be used, which are typically sensitive to seismicity distal from the array footprint and require a smaller number of instruments. Here, we investigate the potential of arrays and array-processing methods to detect and locate subsurface microseismicity at glaciers, benchmarking performance against conventional seismic-network-based methods for an example at an Antarctic ice stream. We also provide an array-processing recipe for body-wave cryoseismology applications. Results from an array and a network deployed at Rutford Ice Stream, Antarctica, show that arrays and networks both have strengths and weaknesses. Arrays can detect icequakes from further distances, whereas networks outperform arrays in more comprehensive studies of a particular process due to greater hypocentral constraint within the network extent. We also gain new insights into seismic behaviour at the Rutford Ice Stream. The array detects basal icequakes in what was previously interpreted to be an aseismic region of the bed, as well as new icequake observations downstream and at the ice stream shear margins, where it would be challenging to deploy instruments. Finally, we make some practical recommendations for future array deployments at glaciers.\n",

      "abstract": "Monitoring bedload transport in rivers is a challenging research domain teeming with technical innovations and methodological developments aimed at improving our knowledge and models of bedload processes at different spatial–temporal scales. Radio frequency identification (RFID) technology has improved sediment tracking, allowing the characterisation of transport processes of individual particles at flood‐event scales. Meanwhile, geophone sensors have enabled the long‐term continuous monitoring of seismic signals that can provide surrogate measures of bedload fluxes at local scales, during flood events and at sediment‐pulses. The combination of these two techniques could allow sediment transport processes to be linked with both flood events and sediment pulses. In this study, we used a combination of active ultra‐high frequency RFID technology and geophone monitoring stations to link the virtual velocity of tracers with seismic activity, hydraulic forcing, and the properties of the tracked particles. Single and multiple regression models show that seismic activity best explained the observed variance (81%) of the virtual velocity of particles, in comparison with discharge (58%) and stream power (63%). Furthermore, when several control variables (seismic activity and particle properties) were combined in an empirical model, the model explained 89% of the variance and allowed quantification of the portions of the variance explained by hydraulic forcing, geophonic activity and tracked particles. These results show the high potential of these combined monitoring techniques for future in‐field experiments to investigate bedload processes at different spatiotemporal scales in rivers of different morphologies.",

A convolutional neural network (CNN) was implemented to automatically classify 15 years of seismic signals recorded by an eight-geophone network installed around the back scarp of the Åknes rock slope in Norway. Eight event classes could be identified and are adapted from the typology proposed by Provost et al. (2018), of which five could be directly related to movements on the slope. Almost 60 000 events were classified automatically based on their spectrogram images. The performance of the classifier is estimated to be near 80 %. The statistical analysis of the results shows a strong seasonality of the microseismic activity at Åknes with an annual increase in springtime when snow melts and the temperature oscillates around the freezing point, mainly caused by events within classes of low-frequency slope quakes and tremors. The clear link between annual temperature variations and microseismic activity could be confirmed, supporting thawing and freezing processes as the origins. Other events such as high-frequency and successive slope quakes occur throughout the year and are potentially related to the steady creep of the sliding plane. The huge variability in the annual event number cannot be solely explained by average temperatures or varying detectability of the network. Groundwater recharge processes and their response to precipitation episodes are known to be a major factor of sliding at Åknes, but the relationship with microseismic activity is less obvious and could not be demonstrated.\n",

      "abstract": "Subglacial water bodies are critical components in analyzing the instability of the Antarctic ice sheet. Their detection and identification normally rely on geophysical and remote sensing methods such as airborne radar echo sounding (RES), ground seismic, and satellite/airborne altimetry and gravity surveys. In particular, RES surveys are able to detect basal terrain with a relatively high accuracy that can assist with the mapping of subglacial hydrology systems. Traditional RES processing methods for the identification of subglacial water bodies mostly rely on their brightness in radargrams and hydraulic flatness. In this study, we propose an automatic method with the main objective to differentiate the basal materials by quantitatively evaluating the shape of the A-scope waveform near the basal interface in RES radargrams, which has been seldom investigated. We develop an automatic algorithm mainly based on the traditional short-time Fourier transform (STFT) to quantify the shape of the A-scope waveform in radargrams. Specifically, with an appropriate window width applied on the main peak of each A-scope waveform in the RES radargram, STFT shows distinct and contrasting frequency responses at the ice-water interface and ice-rock interface, which is largely dependent upon their different reflection characteristics at the basal interface. We apply this method on 882 RES radargrams collected in the Antarctic’s Gamburtsev Province (AGAP) in East Antarctica. There are 8822 identified A-scopes with the calculated detection value larger than the set threshold, out of the overall 1,515,065 valid A-scopes in these 882 RES radargrams. Although these identified A-scopes only takes 0.58% of the overall A-scope population, they show exceptionally continuous distribution to represent the subglacial water bodies. Through a comprehensive comparison with existing inventories of subglacial lakes, we successfully verify the validity and advantages of our method in identifying subglacial water bodies using the detection probability for other basal materials of theoretically the highest along-track resolution. The frequency signature obtained by the proposed joint time–frequency analysis provides a new corridor of investigation that can be further expanded to multivariable deep learning approaches for subglacial and englacial material characterization, as well as subglacial hydrology mapping.",
      "summary": "Subglacial water bodies are critical components in analyzing the instability of the Antarctic ice sheet. We develop an automatic algorithm mainly based on the traditional short-time Fourier transform (STFT) to quantify the shape of the A-scope waveform in radargrams. In particular, RES surveys are able to detect basal terrain with a relatively high accuracy that can assist with the mapping of subglacial hydrology systems. There are 8822 identified A-scopes with the calculated detection value larger than the set threshold, out of the overall 1,515,065 valid A-scopes in these 882 RES radargrams.",

      "abstract": "Variations in subsurface flow processes through a karst aquifer that feeds Bear Spring in southeastern Minnesota were captured on a temporary seismic network during injection experiments and a natural recharge event. Each experiment involved injecting ∼13,000 L of water into an overflow spring, and the natural event was triggered by a large rainstorm of ∼70 min in duration. During the injection experiments, the largest amplitude signals in the ground velocity seismograms occurred as the water first fell onto the rock at the overflow spring and as the large slug of water reached a sump or water‐filled passage. During the natural rainstorm event, the overflow spring began flowing and total spring discharge (perennial emanation points and the overflow spring) increased from ∼100 to 300 L/s. Seismic signals during and following the rain event include broadband noise from raindrops impacting the ground, as well as large amplitude signals while water levels rose; the latter occurred over a 5‐s period, producing multiple pulses of ground motion up to ∼0.5 mm/s. Based on seismic array analysis, high frequency signals during the natural recharge event and one of the injection experiments are largely sourced from south of the array, where a sump exists and the conduit orientation changes, but additional modeling is required to further understand which of a set of possible mechanisms is mostly likely the cause of these seismic signals.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The density structure of firn has implications for hydrological and climate modelling, and ice-shelf stability. The structure of firn can be evaluated from depth models of seismic velocity, widely obtained with Herglotz–Wiechert inversion (HWI), an approach that considers the slowness of refracted seismic arrivals. However, HWI is strictly appropriate only for steady-state firn profiles and the inversion accuracy can be compromised where firn contains ice layers. In these cases, full waveform inversion (FWI) may yield more success than HWI. FWI extends HWI capabilities by considering the full seismic waveform and incorporates reflected arrivals. Using synthetic firn density profiles, assuming both steady- and non-steady-state accumulation, we show that FWI outperforms HWI for detecting ice slab boundaries (5–80 m thick, 5–80 m deep) and velocity anomalies within firn. FWI can detect slabs thicker than one wavelength (here, 20 m, assuming a maximum frequency of 60 Hz) but requires the starting velocity model to be accurate to ±2.5%. We recommend for field practice that the shallowest layers of velocity models are constrained with ground-truth data. Nonetheless, FWI shows advantages over established methods, and should be considered when the characterisation of firn ice slabs is the goal of the seismic survey.",

Due to the high risk of post‐fire debris flows and flooding entering the city, we deployed a network of seismometers within the burn area and downstream drainages to examine the efficacy of seismic monitoring for post‐fire flows. Seismic instruments were deployed during the 2019, 2020, and 2021 monsoon seasons following the fire and recorded several debris flow and flood events, as well as signals associated with rainfall, lightning and wind. Signal power, frequency content, and wave polarization were measured for multiple events and compared to rain gauge records and images recorded by cameras installed in the study area. We use these data to test the efficacy of seismic recordings to (a) detect and differentiate between different energy sources, (b) estimate the timing of lightning strikes, (c) calculate rainfall intensities, and (d) determine debris flow timing, size, velocity, and location. We then calculate forward models of seismic signals associated with debris flows and rainfall to better interpret our results and characterize these events. Our observations and modeling show that we can differentiate between these sources and that seismic data can provide insight into post‐fire debris flow characteristics, including relative particle sizes and velocity.",

      "abstract": "\n Slope disasters, such as landslides and rockfalls, can cause significant safety issues for land and road use in many countries. Therefore, it is important to have effective monitoring and early warning systems in place. Although using images or closed-circuit televisions have some limitations, using seismic data for monitoring can provide real-time information, are useful at night, and are less affected by weather conditions. However, a lack of seismic recordings for different types of slope disasters can limit the use of the seismic method. To collect more seismic recordings, we deployed seismometers in the Luhu mountain area of Miaoli, Taiwan, to record rockfalls, earthquakes, and other natural and human-induced events. To cluster the different types of seismic waveforms present in these recordings, we used deep embedded clustering (DEC), an unsupervised clustering algorithm, to group the recordings based on their features. We selected waveforms with significantly larger amplitudes than background noise and converted them to spectrograms using the short-time Fourier transform as input for DEC. About 45,000 seismic recordings were selected, of which 1951 were manually labeled source classes as external information for finding an optimal number of clusters and evaluating clustering results. The DEC clustering results showed that most seismic recordings of different source classes had distinct features and could be grouped into different clusters. However, different classes of seismic recordings may be assigned to the same cluster if they have similar features on spectrograms but can still be distinguished by other conditions. By utilizing unsupervised clustering to categorize a large number of seismic recordings based on their features, the time required for manual classification can be reduced. The identified seismic recordings of rockfalls will be useful for monitoring and analyzing rockfall hazards using seismic data.",

To understand these complex observations, we compare them with synthetic ellipticity measurements obtained from synthetic ambient noise computed for various seismic velocity and attenuation models, including surface wave overtone effects. We find that in dry snow conditions within the interior of the GrIS, to first order the anomalous ellipticity observations can be explained by ice models associated with the accumulation and densification of snow into firn. We also show that the distribution of ellipticity measurements is strongly sensitive to seismic attenuation and the thermal structure of the ice. Our results suggest that Rayleigh wave ellipticity is well suited for monitoring changes in firn properties and thermal composition of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets in a changing climate.",

      "abstract": "\nContinuous excitation of isolated noise sources leads to repeating wave arrivals in cross correlations of ambient seismic noise, including throughout their coda. These waves propagate from the isolated sources. We observe this effect on correlation wavefields computed from two years of field data recorded at the Gräfenberg array in Germany and two master stations in Europe. Beamforming the correlation functions in the secondary microseism frequency band reveals repeating waves incoming from distinct directions to the West, which correspond to well-known dominant microseism source locations in the Northeastern Atlantic Ocean. These emerge in addition to the expected acausal and causal correlation wavefield contributions by boundary sources, which are converging onto and diverging from the master station, respectively. Numerical simulations reproduce this observation. We first model a source repeatedly exciting a wavelet, which helps illustrate the fundamental mechanism behind repeated wave generation. Second, we model continuously acting secondary microseism sources and find good agreement with our observations. Our observations and modelling have potentially significant implications for the understanding of correlation wavefields and monitoring of relative velocity changes in particular. Velocity monitoring commonly assumes that only multiply scattered waves, originating from the master station, are present in the coda of the correlation wavefield. We show that repeating waves propagating from isolated noise sources may dominate instead, including the very late coda. Our results imply that in the presence of continously acting noise sources, which we show is the case for ordinary recordings of ocean microseisms, velocity monitoring assuming scattered waves may be adversely affected with regard to measurement technique, spatial resolution, as well as temporal resolution. We further demonstrate that the very late coda of correlation functions contains useful signal, contrary to the common sentiment that it is dominated by instrument noise. \n",

      "abstract": "Volcanic inflation and deflation often precede eruptions and can lead to seismic velocity changes ( dv/v $dv/v$ ) in the subsurface. Recently, interferometry on the coda of ambient noise‐cross‐correlation functions yielded encouraging results in detecting these changes at active volcanoes. Here, we analyze seismic data recorded at the Klyuchevskoy Volcanic Group in Kamchatka, Russia, between summer of 2015 and summer of 2016 to study signals related to volcanic activity. However, ubiquitous volcanic tremors introduce distortions in the noise wavefield that cause artifacts in the dv/v $dv/v$ estimates masking the impact of physical mechanisms. To avoid such instabilities, we propose a new technique called time‐segmented passive image interferometry. In this technique, we employ a hierarchical clustering algorithm to find periods in which the wavefield can be considered stationary. For these periods, we perform separate noise interferometry studies. To further increase the temporal resolution of our results, we use an AI‐driven approach to find stations with similar dv/v $dv/v$ responses and apply a spatial stack. The impacts of snow load and precipitation dominate the resulting dv/v $dv/v$ time series, as we demonstrate with the help of a simple model. In February 2016, we observe an abrupt velocity drop due to the M7.2 Zhupanov earthquake. Shortly after, we register a gradual velocity increase of about 0.3% at Bezymianny Volcano coinciding with surface deformation observed using remote sensing techniques. We suggest that the inflation of a shallow reservoir related to the beginning of Bezymianny's 2016/2017 eruptive cycle could have caused this local velocity increase and a decorrelation of the correlation function coda.",

      "abstract": "Understanding the impact forces exerted by debris flows is limited by a lack of direct field measurements and validated numerical models. In this study, we use real‐time impact‐force measurements and field observations of debris flows recorded by a sensor network in Jiangjia Ravine, China, to quantify the impact‐force distribution of natural debris flows. We observed one debris flow event during and after a storm on 25 August 2004, including 42 short‐duration surges and seven long‐duration surges, and impact‐force signals were successfully recorded for 38 surges. Our observed debris flows comprise high‐viscosity laminar flows with high sediment concentration and frequent solid‐to‐solid interactions. We identified a large magnitude (up to 1 kN), high‐frequency (greater than 1 Hz) fluctuating component of the impact force that we interpret as solid particle impact on the sensors. The variability of particle impact forces increases with the mean impact force. Our results show that a log‐logistic distribution can describe the probability density distribution of impact forces. Solid‐dominated surges and fluid‐dominated intersurge flows have similar impact‐force distributions, but surges usually have heavy tails. We created a dimensionless number to describe the impact force and correlated it against existing dimensionless parameters. Finally, we develop a simple particle impact model to understand the relationship between flow dynamics and the impact force inside debris flows that could be applied to improve debris‐flow flume experiments and design debris‐flow hazard mitigation measures.",

Real-time impact-force data and field observations were collected using a sensor network in China. The study observed debris flows with varying surge durations and identified fluctuating components in the impact force.

Some important factors, such as timing and causes of bank erosion, are difficult to assess with established techniques. We explore the capability of smart sensors, actually developed for the agricultural sector, to measure soil moisture and temperature as well as movement in real time on banks of northern rivers in different geographical, climatological and landscape settings. Soil movement and its timing were easy to identify from the measurements, and in many cases, the reason for the onset of movement could be inferred. The sensors automatically upload data with a high temporal resolution for a long period of time, while only minimally disturbing the bank itself. However, the sensor approach has a low spatial resolution (point measurements), and therefore, complementing the measurements with approaches with a high spatial resolution, such as spatially continuous digital elevation models of differencing techniques or seismic sensors, is advised. Overall, the measurement approach using new agricultural sensors has several unique advantages and disadvantages and can be a good tool for the monitoring of river bank erosion and could lead to new insights.",

      "abstract": "Alpine glaciers are rapidly retreating due to global warming and this has been associated with enhanced supply of subglacially derived sediment to downstream environments. We present the first high frequency quantitative record on how the signal of sediment exported from an Alpine glacier is filtered by its proglacial forefield. The data, covering two climatically distinct glacier melt seasons, show that the signal of subglacial bedload export is strongly filtered over short distances, unlike suspended load whose signal is less impacted. The reason is related to the interplay of short particle advection lengths with strong morphodynamic forcing. The subglacial sediment export signal is thus rapidly replaced by one combining (a) the local forcing by stream hydraulics and (b) the reworking of the proglacial braid plain itself. These findings have implications for estimating subglacial erosion rates, natural hazard mitigation, sediment management for hydropower plants and ecological succession related to rapid glacier retreat.",

      "abstract": "The Volcán de Colima, one of the most active volcanoes in Mexico, has experienced several volcanic crises over the last century with the emplacement of voluminous block-and-ash flow deposits providing large volumes of loose material along the main ravines. During the rainy season, this material is easily eroded forming lahars. Over 40 events with variable magnitude (105-106 m3) have been detected each year. The largest events that cause damages to infrastructure are usually triggered during the hurricane season (from mid-August to October) when more than 250 mm of rain usually are accumulated over a few days. On 23 October 2015, Hurricane Patricia hit the Volcán de Colima. The hurricane was announced as having reached category 5 thereby representing the largest ever recorded hurricane event in Mexico. It rapidly weakened after landfall but followed a straight trajectory toward the volcano. Up to 400 mm of rain were recorded over 30 hours. The event was recorded at a monitoring station located in the middle reaches of the La Lumbre ravine on the SW flank of the volcano, which was equipped with a rain gauge, a geophone (10 Hz), and a video camera. A multi-pulse lahar started around 8 pm (GMT) and lasted for more than five hours. The seismic signal and the video images were analyzed to identify the timing of the main pulses, the sediment concentrations, and maximum flow peak discharge. Data show that the lahar was characterized by three main pulses, in the range of debris flows with maximum flow-depth of 8 m, interspersed by more dilute tails as hyperconcentrated flow, as also observed from the frequency contents of the seismic signal. A total volume of 2.5 × 106 m3 was estimated based on the strong correlation between the seismic amplitude and the flow discharge. The lahar destroyed one bridge and ~500 m of the interstate road leaving several villages cut off for a few days. Based on the flow magnitude, duration, and the associated damage, this event probably represents the largest one recorded over the last 20 years. The FLO-2D model was used to replicate the observed event to estimate the maximum inundation limits of lahars along the five principal ravines of the volcano, in an attempt to design a hazard map for catastrophic hurricane-induced events.",
      "summary": "This study examines hurricane-induced lahars at Volcán de Colima in Mexico. Researchers analyzed seismic signals and video images from a monitoring station after Hurricane Patricia in 2015. The analysis identified multiple lahar pulses and estimated the total lahar volume based on seismic amplitude.

Spectra of the velocity time series contain strong daily and sub‐daily behavior indicating that the daily and sub‐daily changes in the seismic velocity are primarily caused by atmospheric tides. We also note the influence of temperature changes on daily variations, but as a second‐order effect. The explanatory model focuses on depth variations of the groundwater table, linking atmospheric pressure (loading and de‐loading the Earth's surface) to variations in seismic velocity.

      "abstract": "Our warming climate is adversely affecting cryospheric landscapes via glacial retreat, permafrost degradation, and associated slope destabilization. In Prince William Sound, Alaska, the rapid retreat of Barry Glacier has destabilized the slopes flanking the glacier, resulting in numerous landslides. The largest of these landslides (∼500 Mm3 in volume) is more than 2 km wide and has the potential to generate a tsunami that could affect nearby recreationists, marine traffic, infrastructure, natural and cultural resources, and the community of Whittier, located 60 km from the landslide. Here, we combine landslide structural and kinematic element mapping with data acquired from bi‐yearly airborne lidar, multi‐week satellite‐based synthetic aperture radar (SAR), sub‐hourly ground‐based SAR, and seismic monitoring from 2020 to 2022 to characterize this landslide and examine its evolution. While some methods serve as a snapshot in time that is a culmination of events, others emphasize the ever‐evolving nature of the landslide and associated hazards. Four major kinematic elements define the overall structure of the landslide, which vary in deformation type and rate, from creep (5 mm per day over several months) to episodic movement (2 m in 30 days) and landslide‐wide to localized events. In some areas of the landslide, short‐term deformation deviates from structures formed by cumulative movement, implying structural and kinematic evolution associated with glacier retreat. These insights are important for assessing landslide hazards and hazard evolution for large, slow‐moving bedrock landslides in actively deglaciating environments.",

This is particularly the case of karst aquifers which knowledge is mostly based on sparse spatial and temporal observations. In this study, we propose a new approach, based on a supervised machine learning algorithm, the Random Forests, and continuous seismic noise records, that allows the prediction of the underground river water height. The study site is a karst aquifer in the Jura Mountains (France). An underground river is accessible through an artificial shaft and is instrumented by a hydrological probe. The seismic noise generated by the river is recorded by two broadband seismometers, located underground (20 m depth) and at the surface. The algorithm succeeds in predicting water height thanks to signal energy features. Even weak river-induced noise such as recorded at the surface can be detected and used by the algorithm. Its efficiency, expressed by the Nash-Sutcliffe criterion, is above 95° and 53° for data from the underground and surface seismic stations, respectively.",

Especially in the Alpine region for temperate based glaciers where the ice rapidly responds to changing climatic conditions and thus, processes are strongly intermittent in time and heterogeneous in space. Spatially dense seismic and Global Positioning System (GPS) measurements are analyzed applying machine learning to gain insight into the processes controlling glacial motions of Glacier d’Argentière. Using multiple bandpass‐filtered copies of the continuous seismic waveforms, we compute energy‐based features, develop a matched field beamforming catalog and include meteorological observations. Features describing the data are analyzed with a gradient boosting decision tree model to directly estimate the GPS displacements from the seismic noise. We posit that features of the seismic noise provide direct access to the dominant parameters that drive displacement on the highly variable and unsteady surface of the glacier. The machine learning model infers daily fluctuations and longer term trends. The results show on‐ice displacement rates are strongly modulated by activity at the base of the glacier. The techniques presented provide a new approach to study glacial basal sliding and discover its full complexity.",

Improving our ability to monitor TWS and drought is critical for water‐resource management and water‐deficit estimation. We use continuous seismic ambient noise to monitor temporal evolution of near‐surface seismic velocity, dv/v, in central Oklahoma from 2013 to 2022. The derived dv/v is found to be negatively correlated with gravitational measurements and groundwater depths, showing the impact of groundwater storage on seismic velocities. The hydrological effects involving droughts and recharge of groundwater occur on a multi‐year time scale and dominate the overall derived velocity changes. The thermoelastic response to atmospheric temperature variations occurs primarily on a yearly timescale and dominates the superposed seasonal velocity changes in this study.

      "abstract": "Abstract. Climate shifts are particularly conspicuous in glaciated areas. Satellite and terrestrial observations show significant increases in the melting and breakup of tidewater glaciers and their influence on sea level rise and ocean mixing. Increasing melt rates are creating an urgency to better understand the link between atmospheric and oceanic conditions and glacier frontal ablation through iceberg calving and melting. Elucidating this link requires a combination of short- and long-timescale measurements of terminus activity. Recent work has demonstrated the potential of using underwater sound to quantify the time and scale of calving events to yield integrated estimates of ice mass loss (Glowacki and Deane, 2020). Here, we present estimates of subaerial calving flux using underwater sound recorded at Hansbreen, Svalbard, in September 2013 combined with an algorithm for the automatic detection of calving events. The method is compared with ice calving volumes estimated from geodetic measurements of the movement of the glacier terminus and an analysis of satellite images. The total volume of above-water calving during the 26 d of acoustical observation is estimated to be 1.7±0.7×107 m3, whereas the subaerial calving flux estimated by traditional methods is 7±2×106 m3. The results suggest that passive cryoacoustics is a viable technique for long-term monitoring of mass loss from marine-terminating glaciers.\n",

      "abstract": "The limestone islands of Malta face high levels of water stress due to low rainfall over a small land area and a high population density. We investigate an innovative, cost-effective approach to groundwater monitoring in an island environment by computing auto- and cross-correlations of ambient seismic noise recorded on short-period and broadband seismic stations. While borehole readings give accurate site-specific water level data of the groundwater across the islands, this technique provides a more regional approach to quantitative groundwater monitoring. We perform the moving window cross-spectral method to determine temporal changes in seismic velocity (δv/v). Comparison of the δv/v with groundwater levels from boreholes and precipitation shows comparable patterns. We find that the variations of the δv/v from auto-correlations are more pronounced than the cross-correlation, and that short-period seismic stations are also sensitive. The δv/v signal deteriorates at longer interstation distances, presumably because paths traverse complex geology. We conclude that changes in the groundwater level found beneath very small islands, even as small as 3 km2, can be detected seismically. Low-cost, easy-to-deploy seismic stations can thus act as an additional tool for groundwater monitoring, especially in places with limited natural water reservoirs, like rivers and lakes, and infrastructure.",

      "abstract": "In response to the challenges of karst geophysical exploration in an environment with strong external interference, this paper proposes a new method, namely the frequency-Bessel transform method, for extracting multi-order dispersion curves of surface waves from background noise to characterize karst. The observation noise data of the Wuhan karst development area are used as an example, where the dolomitic limestone and limestone mixed with dolomite of the Jialing River Formation of the middle lower Triassic are widely developed in the observation area. The frequency-Bessel transform method involves performing a Bessel integral transformation on the cross-correlation coefficient of background noise in the frequency domain. Firstly, by synthesizing theoretical noise data and comparing it with the spatial autocorrelation method—which is currently the main method for extracting the fundamental dispersion curve of surface waves—it is verified that the frequency-Bessel transform method can extract the higher-mode dispersion curve. Then, by taking the actual measured single-point noise data as an example, the effect of applying the frequency-Bessel transform to the actual noise data is tested, and the inversion of the fine structure of the strata by the addition of higher-mode dispersion, the use of the damped least squares inversion method, and the joint inversion of fundamental and higher-mode dispersion curves are analyzed. The higher-mode dispersion curve of Rayleigh surface wave extracted by the frequency-Bessel transform is much clearer, and the 2D shear wave velocity structure profile obtained from inversion explains the karst development area, karst strip area, and thickness of the Quaternary overburden. The inferred results match with the actual borehole data. Multi-mode imaging of background noise based on the frequency-Bessel method can be applied to depict karst in complex backgrounds, and has significant potentiality in the field of ambient seismic noise tomography, providing a new idea and method for karst detection in near-surface engineering.",

To study the ice shelf dynamics, we analyzed seismological and GNSS data from the Ekström Ice Shelf in Dronning Maud Land. We extracted probabilistic power spectral densities (PPSD) in the frequency band 3.4–6.8 Hz, typical of icequakes, from seismological data and observed pronounced signals in the PPSD with near 3 and 4 cycles per day (cpd) corresponding to tidal overharmonics, in addition to the main tidal constituents near 1 and 2 cpd. GNSS data reveal the same components in ice flow speed but not in vertical displacements. Generally, tide-induced grounding line migration modulates the flow velocity of an entire ice shelf. We find that this velocity modulation causes the increased icequake activity in the tidal overharmonics with 3 and 4 cpd in an ice shear zone where the flow velocity drops to nearly zero.",

      "abstract": "\n We propose new methods for assessing temporal changes in seismic velocity using the S-wave coda for repeating earthquakes and cross-correlation functions of ambient noise. For a pair of seismic waveforms representing a common source–receiver path, the relative change in path-averaged velocity over the corresponding time interval is directly proportional to the factor by which one waveform needs to be stretched or compressed with respect to the other to achieve maximum coherence. For an arbitrary number of waveforms, initial pair-wise stretch factors determined through standard approaches can be improved through solution of an overdetermined system and further refined through an iterative approach exploiting the singular value decomposition to minimize rank of the stretched waveform section. We apply this combined approach to both repeating earthquakes and ambient noise correlations for Haida Gwaii in western Canada, the site of a Mw 7.8 thrust earthquake in 2012. Optimal stretch factors for repeating earthquake families indicate that path-averaged S velocities dropped by up to 0.16% after the earthquake. Ambient noise correlations indicate that velocities dropped by between 0.26% and 0.39%, which we interpret to be more pronounced in the uppermost levels of the crust. We explore these results in terms of changes in crustal porosity and hydrogeologic conditions by considering the observation that hot spring activity on Haida Gwaii ceased following the 2012 mainshock and recovered over the next several years.",

This observation has been linked to relaxation, a phenomenon observed in a wide class of materials after straining perturbations.

The absence of rainfall in this area allows study of the mechanical state of the subsurface by limiting the potential effect of variable groundwater content. I show that relaxation timescales are a function of the current state of the subsurface when perturbed by earthquakes, rather than ground shaking intensity. Our study highlights the predictability of earthquake damage dynamics in the Earth's near-surface and potentially other materials. I propose to reconcile this paradigm with existing physical frameworks by considering the superposition of different populations of damaged contacts.",

      "abstract": "Abstract. The sediments underneath Mexico City have unique mechanical properties that give rise to strong site effects. We investigated temporal changes in the seismic velocity at strong-motion and broadband seismic stations throughout Mexico City, including sites with different geologic characteristics ranging from city center locations situated on lacustrine clay to hillside locations on volcanic bedrock.\nWe used autocorrelations of urban seismic noise, enhanced by waveform clustering, to extract subtle seismic velocity changes by coda wave interferometry. We observed and modeled seasonal, co- and post-seismic changes, as well as a long-term linear trend in seismic velocity.\nSeasonal variations can be explained by self-consistent models of thermoelastic and poroelastic changes in the subsurface shear wave velocity. Overall, sites on lacustrine clay-rich sediments appear to be more sensitive to seasonal surface temperature changes, whereas sites on alluvial and volcaniclastic sediments and on bedrock are sensitive to precipitation. The 2017 Mw 7.1 Puebla and 2020 Mw 7.4 Oaxaca earthquakes both caused a clear drop in seismic velocity, followed by a time-logarithmic recovery that may still be ongoing for the 2017 event at several sites or that may remain incomplete. The slope of the linear trend in seismic velocity is correlated with the downward vertical displacement of the ground measured by interferometric synthetic aperture radar, suggesting a causative relationship and supporting earlier studies on changes in the resonance frequency of sites in the Mexico City basin due to groundwater extraction.\nOur findings show how sensitively shallow seismic velocity and, in consequence, site effects react to environmental, tectonic and anthropogenic processes. They also demonstrate that urban strong-motion stations provide useful data for coda wave monitoring given sufficiently high-amplitude urban seismic noise.\n",

In addition to the different methodologies for computing the cross correlation functions, we also examine the relative importance of signal‐to‐noise ratio and number of wavelengths propagating between station pairs to determine data/solution quality. We find that the lower number of wavelengths of 3 has the greatest impact on the network‐averaged group velocity curve. Lastly, we test the sensitivity of the number of stacks used to create the final empirical Green's function, and find that the PCC‐PWS method required about half the number of cross‐correlation functions to develop reliable velocity curves compared to the TCC‐Lin method. This is an important advantage of the PCC‐PWS method when available data collection time is limited.",

Prior to slope failure, cracks in the weakened rock are thought to grow and coalesce, eventually forming a continuous failure plane. Here, we apply a hidden Markov machine learning model to seismic data, revealing the temporal evolution of cracks prior to a major rockslide event in the Swiss Alps. After prolonged linear increase of the crack cumulative number, an S-shaped crack rate pattern occurred in the day before the rockslide. A simple mechanistic model can explain this behaviour, showing that total crack boundary length is the key factor controlling failure plane evolution immediately before mass movement. Our findings imply that cracks should be treated as 2-D, rather than 1-D objects, and that slope failure can be driven predominantly by internal rather than external processes.

      "abstract": "Seismological data plays a crucial role in timely slope failure hazard assessments. However, identifying rockfall waveforms from seismic data poses challenges due to their high variability across different events and stations. To address this, we propose RockNet, a deep-learning-based multitask model capable of detecting both rockfall and earthquake events at both the single-station and local seismic network levels. RockNet consists of two submodels: the single-station model, which computes waveform masks for earthquake and rockfall signals and performs earthquake $P$ and $S$ phase picking simultaneously on single-station seismograms, and the association model, which determines the occurrences of local seismic events by aggregating hidden feature maps from the trained single-station model across all stations. Since the rockfall data is relatively scarce and may not be sufficient to train a deep-learning model effectively, we augment the dataset with abundant nonrockfall data and add additional tasks to promote shared interpretability and robustness. RockNet is trained and tested on a local dataset collected from the Luhu tribe in Miaoli, Taiwan, achieving macro F1-scores of 0.983 and 0.990 for the single-station model and the association model, respectively. Furthermore, we evaluate RockNet on an independent dataset collected from the Super-Sauze unstable slope region in France, and it demonstrates good generalization performance in discriminating earthquake, rockfall, and noise with a macro F1-score of 0.927. This study highlights the potential of deep learning in leveraging diverse types of inputs for seismic signal detection even with limited training data.",

      "abstract": "Monitoring groundwater levels in aquifers is crucial for water resources management on a global scale. In Greece, water stress is particularly high due to the expansion of agricultural land, urbanization and tourism, leading to aquifer over‐exploitation. In this study, we investigate the possibility of monitoring groundwater reservoirs from seismic velocity changes (δv/v) measured using noise autocorrelations. The results obtained at short periods (0.5–3 s) indicate that in several regions, seismic wave velocity varies according to an annual cycle mainly controlled by aquifer loading and discharge. We also predict seismic velocity variations from a simple model using precipitation records. In addition, this model provides a proxy for the characteristic time of aquifer discharge rate and allows us to distinguish shallow alluvial aquifers (∼100 m) from deep karst systems (∼1 km). Finally, we study the effect of water pumping from groundwater reservoirs. To that end, we combine Global Positioning System (GPS), hydraulic heads and velocity variations measurement. The results indicate that confined and unconfined aquifers respond differently. While for unconfined aquifers, pumping water implies an uplift of the surface, we show that for confined aquifers a subsidence occurs, due to the consolidation of the sediments at depth. Being an in‐situ and volumetric measurement, the δv/v is primarily sensitive to the amount of water stored in the entire aquifer system, whereas GPS measurements provide the deformation at the surface induced by both deep sediment compaction and water level variations. These observations show that GPS, hydraulic head, and δv/v are complementary tools to monitor aquifers.",

The estimated attenuation is compared against three environmental variables: rainfall, temperature, and traffic volume. The results show that the estimated seismic attenuation correlates most strongly with precipitation with positive time lags, suggesting a high attenuation sensitivity to changes in soil moisture and groundwater system.

Here, we combine icequake cluster analysis with coda wave interferometry constraining damage growth on Switzerland's Eiger hanging glacier before a 15,000 m3 break‐off event. The method focuses on icequake migration within clusters rather than previously proposed “event counting.” Results show that one cluster originated from the glacier front and migrated by 13.9(±1.2) m within 5 weeks before the break‐off event. The corresponding crevasse extension separates unstable and stable ice masses. We use the measured source displacement for damage parametrization and find a 90% agreement between an analytical model based on damage mechanics and frontal flow velocities measured with an interferometric radar. Our analysis provides observational constraints for damage growth, which to date is primarily a theoretical concept for modeling englacial fractures.",

      "abstract": "Harvesting geothermal energy often leads to a pressure drop in reservoirs, decreasing their profitability and promoting the formation of steam caps. While steam caps are valuable energy resources, they also alter the reservoir thermodynamics. Accurately measuring the steam fraction in reservoirs is essential for both operational and economic perspectives. However, steam content estimations are very limited both in space and time since current methods rely on direct measurements within production wells. Besides, these estimations normally present large uncertainties. Here, we present a pioneering method for indirectly sampling the steam content in the subsurface using the ever-present seismic background noise. We observe a consistent annual velocity drop in the Hengill geothermal field (Iceland) and establish a correlation between the velocity drop and steam buildup using in-situ borehole data. This application opens new avenues to track the evolution of any gas reservoir in the crust with a surface-based and cost-effective method. A correlation between seismic velocity changes and steam build-up is observed in the Hengill geothermal field (Iceland) using seismic noise interferometry, providing a surface-based and cost-effective monitoring tool for gas reservoirs in the crust.",

      "abstract": "Abstract. Subglacial floods cause seismic tremors that can be located and tracked in space and time using a seismic array. Here, we shed light on the generating mechanisms of the seismic signals observed during the largest measured flood from the eastern Skaftá cauldron in the Vatnajökull ice cap, Iceland. We track the propagation of the flood in 2015 using two seismic arrays and a local seismic network in combination with GPS, hydrological, and geochemical data. We find that as the water drained from the subglacial lake beneath the cauldron, families of icequakes were generated in the area around the cauldron, while the glacier surface gradually subsided by more than 100 m. We detected a several-hours-long, non-harmonic tremor and high-frequency transient events migrating downglacier, following the subglacial flood front. We suggest that this tremor is composed of repeating, closely spaced icequakes that were generated as the glacier was being lifted, cracked, and deformed, thus enabling the subglacial water flow. When the lake had largely drained, the pressure within the underlying hydrothermal system dropped. At this time, we recorded minute-long tremor bursts emanating from the cauldron area, followed by an hour-long harmonic tremor each. We interpret these as being caused by hydrothermal explosions in the geothermal system within the cauldron and as being vigorous boiling in the crustal rocks, respectively, which is an interpretation corroborated by floodwater geochemical signals. Finally, the flood also led to detectable tremor due to more energetic flow in the rapids near Sveinstindur in the Skaftá river. We conclude that the flood generated five different seismic signal types that can be associated with five different geophysical processes, including the wide spectrum from brittle failure and explosions to boiling and turbulent flow.\n",

The research tracks the flood's progression using seismic arrays, GPS, and hydrological data.

      "abstract": "An unusual, high-alpine, rapid debris slide originating in ice-rich debris occurred on June 28, 2022, at 16:33:16 MDT at the head of Chaos Canyon, a formerly glacier-covered valley in Rocky Mountain National Park, CO, USA. In this study, we integrate eyewitness videos and seismic records of the event with meteorological data, field observations, pre- and post-event satellite imagery, and uncrewed aircraft vehicle imagery to characterize the event and future hazards it may pose. Deformation of the eventual slide mass preceded rapid failure by decades, starting in the early to mid-2000s, accelerating in 2018 (the warmest year on record), and reaching ~ 20 m/year in 2021. The main event, which was preceded by smaller sliding episodes earlier that day, had a volume of ~ 2.1 million m3, reached peak velocities of about 5 m/s, slid on a surface up to 80 m deep, and moved up to ~ 245 m downslope in < 2 min. We observed blocks of frozen debris (permafrost) in the landslide deposits. Within ~ 2 weeks, these blocks had melted and became dry, conical debris mounds (molards). We hypothesize that the rapid slide was induced by gradually increasing long-term air temperatures that thawed ice and increased pore pressures. The presence and suspected influence of permafrost on the occurrence of this landslide indicate other slopes in the park, and other moderate-to-low latitude alpine regions may experience similar slope stability issues as temperatures continue to warm.",
      "summary": "This study investigates a significant debris slide that occurred in Chaos Canyon, Colorado, in 2022. The research integrates seismic data, field observations, and remote sensing techniques to understand the event. Findings indicate that the landslide was preceded by decades of deformation, accelerating with rising temperatures. The authors hypothesize that thawing ice and increased pore pressures due to warming temperatures may have contributed to the rapid slide.",

      "abstract": "This study investigates changes in seismic velocities in the period 1999–2021 using about 700 permanent and temporary broadband seismic stations in the state of California. We compute single‐station cross‐correlations of the ambient seismic noise and use the coda‐wave interferometry to measure the changes in seismic velocities (dv/v) using a stretching technique. We focus on the 2–4 Hz frequency band and the upper 500 m of the near‐surface sensitivity. We discuss dv/v within the context of nonlinear elasticity. We fit models of thermoelastic strains, various hydrological models that diffuse rainwater, and slow‐dynamics healing models for the postseismic response of earthquakes. In general, we find that both thermoelastic strains and hydrological strains have a similar amplitude of impacts on dv/v. We find that the diffusion of rainwater using a drained response in a poroelastic medium explains most of the data. The best fit hydraulic diffusivity is high in the mountains and low in the basin. We find that the largest drop in seismic velocity occurs during the 2004–2005 wet winter and that the 2011–2016. Drought is characterized by a multiyear marked increase in dv/v. We interpret site‐specific variations with land subsidence or inflation detected by remote sensing. We also find a decade‐long postseismic response of two major earthquakes and bound the time scale of relaxation processes to a few years. Together, we see long‐term changes in seismic velocities showing a positive trend over two decades that we can interpret as long‐term lowering of the groundwater table.",

      "abstract": "Radio Echo Sounding (RES) surveys conducted in May 2010 and April 2011 revealed a 2 km2 flat area with increased bed reflectivity at the base of Isunnguata Sermia at the western margin of the Greenland Ice Sheet. This flat reflector was located within a localized subglacial hydraulic potential (hydropotential) minimum, as part of a complex and elongated trough system. By analogy with comparable features in Antarctica, the initial interpretation of such a feature was a potential subglacial lake. In September 2013 a co‐located seismic survey revealed a 1,750 m by 540 and 37 m thick stratified lens‐shaped bedform at the base of a subglacial trough system. Amplitude Versus Angle (AVA) analysis yields a derived reflection coefficient R = 0.09 ± 0.14 indicative of consolidated sediments possibly overlain by dilatant till. The bed and flank on the northern side of the trough consist of unconsolidated, possibly water‐bearing sediments with R = −0.10 ± 0.08, whereas on the southern side it consists of more consolidated material. We interpret the trough as a key component of the wider subglacial drainage network, for which the sediments on its northern side act as a localized water‐storage reservoir. Given the observation of seasonally forming and rapidly draining supraglacial meltwater lakes in this area, we interpret the lens‐shaped bedform as deposited by episodically ponding meltwater within the subglacial trough system. Our results highlight the importance of transient subglacial hydrological and sedimentological processes such as drainage events for the interaction of ice sheets and their substrates, to understand ice dynamics in a warming climate.",

Through manual identification and cross‐correlation analysis, 2,237 discrete icequakes (1.5 ≤ ${\\le} $ ML ≤ ${\\le} $ 2.6) are detected in two spatial clusters, one located at the grounding line of the Foundation Ice Stream (2,219 event detections) and a second located further upstream proximal to a subglacial ridge (18 event detections). Seismicity is predominantly concentrated in the Schmidt Hills, located adjacent to the grounding line of the Foundation Ice Stream, and shows clear ocean tide modulation. Seismic events primarily occur during spring tides, and, on a shorter timescale, concurrent with the rising tide preceding daily maximum high tide. The seismicity can be attributed to stick‐slip motion and fracturing that preferentially occur during rising tides. Seismicity located further upstream in the southern portion of the Foundation Ice Stream most likely reflects basal stick‐slip processes associated with the subglacial topographic high.",

      "abstract": "Pyroclastic density currents (PDCs) are dangerous flows of volcanic rock and gas that are the most deadly proximal volcano hazard. There is significant interest in better understanding PDC dynamics, however, they are challenging to study due to their extreme hazard, unpredictable occurrence, and because complex internal dynamics are obscured by visually opaque clouds of ash. PDCs exert forces on Earth's surface and generate seismic waves. Here, we use seismic data recorded by the permanent monitoring network at Mt. Etna (Italy) to track the 11 February 2014 PDC at second‐scale temporal resolution and calculate a maximum velocity of 76 m/s (274 km/hr). We identify multiple pulses and show that the late‐stage source locations correspond with the mapped coarse‐grained PDC deposits. High temporal and spatial resolution measurements of PDC movement from seismic data can be used to inform numerical modeling of PDC dynamics and aid in hazard assessment by improving our understanding of PDC flow paths. This work illustrates how seismic signals can be used to track surficial mass movements in real‐time.",

      "abstract": "Recent developments in predicting and interpreting seismoelectric (SE) signals suggest a great potential for studying near‐surface hydrogeological properties, particularly in the vadose zone. Previous studies have revealed that the SE spectral ratios obtained from earthquake‐triggered SE data contain valuable hydrogeological information concerning porous media (e.g., permeability, porosity, fluid viscosity, and salinity). This study introduces Multi‐Channel SeismoElectric Spectral Ratios (MC‐SESRs) by considering an active seismic source acting on the ground surface. The frequency‐ and saturation‐dependent excess charge density is adopted to calculate the cross‐coupling coefficients. Applying a supervised learning task based on a flat neural network, the so‐called “broad learning (BL)” model, to map and extract the features of MC‐SESRs data, we seek to determine the permeability and the water table depth. Our results indicate that (a) MC‐SESRs are sensitive to the water table depth and permeability; (b) using more traces of SESRs data for inversion can increase accuracy; and (c) the changing water table can be rapidly determined by the MC‐SESRs by resorting to the BL inverse model, and it can attain an excellent accuracy while disturbed by data noise and misspecified model parameters (e.g., porosity and permeability) with errors of up to 20%. The proposed MC‐SESRs inversion has potential applications for non‐invasive monitoring in shallow porous media (e.g., frost thawing and geothermal upwelling).",

      "abstract": "Cenozoic sediments from the continental rise off the George V Land consist of silty/clayey facies variably rich in diatom ooze; these sediments hold a record of the glacial history of the Wilkes Subglacial Basin and are important for estimating the contribution of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet to global sea level changes during past transition to warmer climates. This is fundamental to predict future scenarios related to the global warming. The petrophysical properties of Antarctic marine sediments are influenced by the ice sheet dynamics and may affect the amplitude of seismic reflections. Through a seismic‐to‐well tie procedure, we investigate the origin of high amplitude reflections from Miocene‐early Pliocene deposits identified in two seismic lines crossing at the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Expedition 318 drill site U1359. Downhole and core log measurements are preconditioned and merged to obtain complete velocity and density records from the sea floor to the bottom of the deepest of the four wells drilled at this site. We generate a synthetic trace by convolving the reflectivity series with the seismic wavelet obtained from the sea‐floor reflection and match the synthetic trace to the seismic data with a time variant cross‐correlation procedure. This procedure established a robust time‐depth relationship, not achievable from the available small‐offset seismic data. To our knowledge, this is the first seismic‐to‐well tying in the George V Land area. Based on results from synthetic data, the anomalous high amplitude seismic package can be linked to changes in density of sediments. Such changes are interpreted as representative for the alternation of diatom‐rich (warm climate) and silty‐clay layers with ice‐rafted debris (cold climate) inside the deposits. We suggest that the analysis of the characteristics and the distribution of similar seismic anomaly around Antarctica can give insight into the modality of past Antarctic ice sheet dynamics.",

In these and other areas of study, acoustic methods have found useful application to detect and quantify the operation of important landscape processes. In some, such as the recording of river discharge, the occurrence of rare events such as exfoliation or the presence and movement of dust devils (willy-willies), the use of acoustic methods is still in a relatively early stage of development and testing. The use of acoustic methods in the recording of rainfall occurrence and intensity is also developing and has the capacity to yield data with higher temporal resolution than can be achieved using conventional rain gauges. Novel acoustic methods include the analysis of the sound recorded by security cameras, which potentially form a vast network of observing stations. The frequencies of sound generated by land-surface processes include audible sound, ultrasound and infrasound at frequencies below the human hearing range. All appear to provide opportunities for further development of useful research tools and methodologies.",

      "abstract": "Tailings dams retain the waste by-products of mining operations and are among the world’s largest engineered structures. Recent tailings dam failures highlight important gaps in current monitoring methods. Here we demonstrate how ambient noise interferometry can be applied to monitor dam performance at an active tailings dam using a geophone array. Seismic velocity changes of less than 1% correlate strongly with water level changes at the adjacent tailings pond. We implement a power-law relationship between effective stress and shear wave velocity, using the pond level recordings with shear wave velocity profiles obtained from cone penetration tests to model changes in shear wave velocities. The resulting one-dimensional model shows good agreement with the seismic velocity changes. As shear wave velocity provides a direct measure of soil stiffness and can be used to infer numerous other geotechnical design parameters, this method provides important advances in understanding changes in dam performance over time. Ambient seismic noise interferometry combined with a quantitative stress model can be used to determine changes in seismic wave velocity and, by extension, other geotechnical parameters which are critical to monitoring tailings dam performance",
      "summary": "This study explores new methods for monitoring the performance of tailings dams. The researchers applied ambient noise interferometry to an active tailings dam using a geophone array. They found that small seismic velocity changes correlated with water level changes in the adjacent pond. These seismic observations, combined with stress models, offer a way to understand changes in dam performance over time.",

In addition to the role of firn in thermally isolating underlying glacial ice, it defines near-surface elastic and density structure and strongly influences high-frequency (> 5 Hz) seismic phenomena observed near the surface. We investigate high-frequency seismic data collected with an array of seismographs deployed on the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) near WAIS Divide camp in January 2019. Cross-correlations of anthropogenic noise originating from the approximately 5 km-distant camp were constructed using a 1 km-diameter circular array of 22 seismographs. We distinguish three Rayleigh (elastic surface) wave modes at frequencies up to 50 Hz that exhibit systematic spatially varying particle motion characteristics. The horizontal-to-vertical ratio for the second mode shows a spatial pattern of peak frequencies that matches particle motion transitions for both the fundamental and second Rayleigh modes. This pattern is further evident in the appearance of narrow band spectral peaks. We find that shallow lateral structural variations are consistent with these observations, and model spectral peaks as Rayleigh wave amplifications within similarly scaled shallow basin-like structures delineated by the strong velocity and density gradients typical of Antarctic firn.",

      "abstract": "It is critical to understand the dynamic conditions of Earth's cryosphere, yet the subglacial and englacial environments that control many aspects of ice behavior are inherently difficult to observe. The study of seismicity in glaciers and ice sheets has provided valuable insights about the cryosphere for decades, more recently aided by tools from machine learning. Here, we present an unsupervised machine‐learning approach to discovering and interpreting cryoseismic patterns using 5 weeks of seismic data recorded at Gornergletscher, Switzerland. Our algorithm utilizes non‐negative matrix factorization and hidden Markov modeling to reduce spectrograms into characteristic, low‐dimensional “fingerprints,” which we reduce further using principal component analysis, then cluster using k‐means clustering. We investigate the timing, locations, and statistical properties of the clusters in relation to temperature, GPS and lake‐level measurements, and find that signals associated with lake flooding tend to occupy one cluster, whereas signals associated with afternoon and evening melt‐water flow reside in others. We suggest that the one cluster contains signals that include the true initiation of the flood's englacial and subglacial drainage components. This work demonstrates an unsupervised machine‐learning approach to exploring both continuous and event‐based glacial seismic data.",

      "abstract": "Seismic geophones have been frequently used in combination with metal plates to indirectly estimate bedload flux in gravel bed mountain rivers. This indirect method has been calibrated with direct measurements in several conditions and proved effective to provide relevant information on spatial and temporal scales otherwise impossible to explore. Notwithstanding, a detailed description of the vibration modes of the plate is still lacking, limiting the possibility to interpret the signal. Here, we report on two sets of experiments where we explored the geoplate response in terms of frequency and amplitude of different vibrational modes. A first set of dry experiments was designed to investigate the variability of the signal as a function of the impact location on the plate. A second set reproduced standard flow conditions, with single pebbles transported by the flow. Results highlighted the occurrence of two main vibration modes, with a first rapid phase (about 5 ms) characterized by higher frequencies, and a second longer and more stable phase of vibration with a frequency in the range of 300–400 Hz. The signal of single impacts showed a good correlation with pebble mass, with only the number of impacts on the plate depending on the flow conditions. The evaluation of the grain size is a challenge given the variability of the signal generated by similar impacts. We propose a filtering strategy to improve grain size estimation. Our analysis shows that a more detailed understanding of the vibrational modes helps identifying best practices for an improved signal acquisition and elaboration.",

      "abstract": "In mountain rivers, long‐term observations of water and sediment fluxes are crucial for understanding the dynamics of bedload fluctuations. We analyze 7 years of continuous data gathered from eight geophone plates at a monitoring station in the glacier‐fed Sulden/Solda River (South Tyrol, Italy) to estimate the bedload flux at 1‐min scale. Sixty‐five bedload samples were used to derive the calibration equations adopted to quantify the transported bedload mass. The signal power is proposed as a more effective metric than threshold‐based impulses for calculating bedload masses. Results show (a) a remarkable variability of bedload rates for the same value of flow discharge, (b) the joint effect of storm‐driven flood events and seasonal changes in sediment supply on bedload rates, and (c) the strong impact of climatic factors (i.e., temperature and snow cover) on bedload fluxes. Moderate bedload rates occurring in late spring/early summer are likely related to the mobilization of riverbed sediments, while sustained bedload transport during melt flows in July–August—corresponding to the effective bedload discharge range—is associated with the activation of glacial and proglacial sediment sources. The data set shows a complex climatic control on bedload transport at the basin scale, where precipitation, air temperature, and snow cover determine flow and glacier melting dynamics. These findings suggest how the effects of climate change in the Alps likely will lead to an increase in peak bedload rates in a context of declining annual bedload yields as melt flows will progressively reduce in the next decades.",

      "abstract": "Continuous seismic signals are proposed as a useful quantitative information source for the estimation of rockfall properties. However, few studies have examined the characteristics of the seismic signal of fragmentation‐related rockfalls. In this study, a series of laboratory experiments designed with crushable analog blocks freefalling and impacting on a thin horizontal plate under different initial conditions (e.g., block volume, strength and fall height) were conducted. Strong correlations are observed between the rockfall properties and the seismic parameters when considering the rock fragmentation during impact. However, these relationships are observed only when the variation in potential energy spans over one order of magnitude, indicating that the application of seismic signals is limited by rockfall properties. In particular, the seismic energy calculated by the diffuse method is the most stable seismic parameter that is highly correlated with the potential energy of rockfalls. By compiling the available data of the seismic signals of both natural and experimental rockfalls from previous studies and our experiments, we found that the relationship between the seismic energy and the potential energy of rockfalls follows a power law model at all scales. The exponent of the power law function ranges from 1.11 to 1.69. Rock strength can significantly affect the seismic features, which are quantitatively discussed. Rock fragmentation acts as an intermediate variable, which is controlled by rockfall properties and consequently affects the corresponding seismic characteristics. Furthermore, rock fragmentation reduces the efficiency of the conversion of potential energy to seismic energy of rockfalls.",

      "abstract": "Abstract. The Swiss plate geophone (SPG) system has been installed and tested in more than 20 steep gravel-bed streams and rivers, and related studies generally resulted in rather robust calibration relations between signal impulse counts and transported bedload mass. Here, we compare this system with three alternative surrogate measuring systems. A variant of the SPG system uses the same frame (housing) set-up but with an accelerometer instead of a geophone sensor to measure the vibrations of the plate (GP-Acc, for geophone plate accelerometer). The miniplate accelerometer (MPA) system has a smaller dimension of the impact plate and is embedded in more elastomer material than the SPG system. The Japanese pipe microphone (JPM) is a 1 m long version of the system that has been installed in many streams in Japan. To compare the performance of the four systems, we used calibration measurements with direct bedload samples from three field sites and an outdoor flume facility with controlled sediment feed. At our field sites, the systems with an accelerometer and a microphone showed partly large temporal variations in the background noise level, which may have impaired the calibration measurements obtained during certain time periods. Excluding these periods, the SPG, GP-Acc, and JPM all resulted in robust\ncalibration relations, whereas the calibration of the MPA system showed a\npoorer performance at all sites.\n",

      "abstract": "Abstract. The estimation of debris flow velocity and volume is a fundamental task for the development of early warning systems and the design of control structures and of other mitigation measures. Debris flow velocity can be calculated using seismic data recorded at two monitoring stations located along the channel, and previous analysis of the seismic energy produced by debris flows showed that the peak discharge of each surge can be estimated based on the maximum amplitude of the seismic signal. This work provides a first approach for estimating the total volume of debris flows from the integrated seismic energy detected with simple, low-cost geophones installed along a debris flow channel. The developed methods were applied to seismic data collected from 2014 to 2018 in three different test sites in the European Alps: Gadria and Cancia (Italy) and Lattenbach (Austria). An adaptable cross-correlation time window was used to calculate the velocity of the different surges, which can offer a better estimation of the velocity compared to a constant window length. The analyses of the seismic data of 14 debris flows show the strong control of the sampling rate and of the inter-station distance on velocity estimation. A linear relationship between the squares of seismic amplitudes – a proxy for seismic energy – and independent measurements of the debris flow volume is proposed for a first-order estimation of the latter. Uncertainties in the volume estimations are controlled by flow properties – such as liquid or viscous surges generating low-amplitude signals and thus underestimating the calculated volume – but in most cases (9 out of 11 events of the test dataset of the Illgraben basin, CH) the order of magnitude of the debris flow volume is correctly predicted.\n",

      "abstract": "Internal erosion caused by infiltration and piping is the main cause of earthen dams’ failures. Traditional methods of inspection are not representative and are unable to cover the entire structure. The seismic interferometry emerges as an alternative for continuous monitoring earthen dams from the detection of variations in seismic velocities caused by water saturation. The objective of this study is the geophysical investigation of the Paranoá’s dam (Brasília, DF, Brazil) in hypothetical infiltration scenarios. To obtain a geological model that represents the expected structure, we performed an acquisition with active sources in the region and applied inversion techniques to retrieve the seismic velocities. We simulated acquisitions in a simple geological model of two horizontal layers for better understanding the behavior of the retrieved seismograms. The results show that more recording time and a wide receiver coverage improves the signal-to-noise ratio. We simulated a layer saturation by varying the velocities and noticed that the method was able to detect such variations. We noticed alterations in the reflection hyperbola asymptotes and in the first arrival time through the seismograms. The method also verified velocity changes in a more complex geological model. Our results suggest that the traffic energy is sufficient to image the dam’s structure, even not satisfying the theoretical diffuse wave field condition. Furthermore, we implemented a technique to monitor velocity variations using the semblance calculation. The method detected variations in the structure Vp in the order of 10%.",

      "abstract": "Extreme events will become more common due to global change, requiring enhanced monitoring and pushing conventional observation networks to their limits. This encourages us to combine all the possible sources of information to obtain a complete picture of extreme events and their evolution. This commentary builds on an example of the July 2021 catastrophic floods that hit northwest Europe, for which the use of seismometer and gravimeter captures complementary data and brings a new understanding of the event and its dynamics. A sudden increase in seismic noise coincides with the testimony reporting on a “tsunami” downstream of the geophysical station. Concurrently, the gravimeter showed increasing saturation of the weathered zone, showing less and less water accumulation and increasing runoff. When rain re‐intensified after a 3‐hr break, the subsoil's saturation state induced an accelerated runoff increase, as revealed by the river flow, in a much stronger way than during the rainy episodes just before. We show that the gravimeter detected the saturation of the catchment subsoil and soil in real‐time. When the rain re‐intensified, this saturation resulted in a sudden, devastating and deadly flood. Our study opens up the possibility of integrating real‐time gravity in early warning systems for such events.",

For a similar sphere impact set-up, the finite element method was used to determine the propagation characteristics of the stress wave in the structure of the monitoring system. The experimental and numerical results showed a qualitative and partially quantitative agreement in the changes in the number of signal impulses per particle mass, the amplitude, and the centroid frequency with increasing colliding sphere size. These parameters characterizing the geophone vibrations also showed qualitatively similar dependencies with increasing bedload size as field measurements show with natural particles and a theoretical model.

We use frequency-dependent polarization analysis (FDPA) to classify types of GHT and assess its spatio-temporal extent beneath Rhonegletscher, Switzerland, in a continuous seismic record through 2018 and 2019 at three ice-proximal bedrock-based seismometers. We determine the frequency bands composing the GHT and calculate back azimuth angles pointing to a previously known subglacial channel. We also inspect the relationship between GHT seismic power and water discharge from the glacier to compare daily and seasonal shifts with the observed GHT. We observed the seasonal shift from a distributed system to a channelized system, and our dataset allowed comparison of channel locations within and across seasons, with implications for sediment evacuation and bed erosion.

High‐resolution geophysical methods may be of valuable help in monitoring the water masses, both in space and time. Passive seismic interferometry takes advantage of ambient seismic noise to recover the variations in seismic wave velocity induced by changes in groundwater. We present hereafter the time and space monitoring of an hydraulic dome artificially formed to prevent biological and chemical pollutants from entering the exploitation field of Crépieux‐Charmy (Lyon, France). We use a dense seismic network to passively monitor the water table changes induced by infilling of an infiltration basin at the water supply facility for the two million inhabitants of the Lyon Metropolis (France). We assess the hourly seismic velocity variations over 19 days, during which two filling and drainage cycles were performed. The use of a dense three‐component seismic network allows fine characterization of the seismic wavefield, and offers the possibility to include the analysis of 4,851 raypaths in a robust inversion algorithm based on ray theory. The velocity variations are mapped with high resolution. They are directly related to the water table variations and to residual water saturation changes within the unsaturated zone. This seismic experiment highlights the three‐dimensional (3D) implementation and evolution of a hydraulic dome under the infiltration basin. This dynamic information helps in the understanding and modeling of water flows between the water table and a river, which represents a fundamental issue for discussions on the effectiveness of the barrier.",

      "abstract": "Accumulating evidence suggests that glacier basal motion can produce seismogenic stick‐slip events caused by frictional resistance at the ice‐bed interface. Frequent and subsequent failure of multiple stick‐slip patches may constitute sliding tremor in seismic recordings. We show that during stick‐slip tremor at the base of an Alpine glacier, the released seismic moment increases by an order of magnitude. The tremor emerges during melt‐intensive days and is associated with water pressure peaks in a nearby subglacial channel. We propose an extended slider‐block model that explains the regular occurrence of stick‐slip tremor by coupling seismically sliding patches to surrounding aseismically sliding bed regions. The model predicts that the stick‐slip patches control the movement of their surrounding smoothly sliding bed regions via elastic coupling and stress transfer. Thus, tremor producing stick‐slip patches could affect large‐scale ice flow to a degree, which is underestimated in models, with implications on sea level rise projections.",

      "abstract": "The spatio‐temporal variability of bedload transport processes poses considerable challenges for bedload monitoring systems. One such system, the Swiss plate geophone (SPG), has been calibrated in several gravel‐bed streams using direct sampling techniques. The linear calibration coefficients linking the signal recorded by the SPG system to the transported bedload can vary between different monitoring stations by about a factor of six, for reasons that remain unclear. Recent controlled flume experiments allowed us to identify the grain‐size distribution of the transported bedload as a further site‐specific factor influencing the signal response of the SPG system, along with the flow velocity and the bed roughness. Additionally, impact tests performed at various field sites suggested that seismic waves generated by impacting particles can propagate over several plates of an SPG array, and thus potentially bias the bedload estimates. To gain an understanding of this phenomenon, we adapted a test flume by installing a partition wall to shield individual sensor plates from impacting particles. We show that the SPG system is sensitive to seismic waves that propagate from particle impacts on neighboring plates or on the concrete bed close to the sensors despite isolating elements. Based on this knowledge, we designed a filter method that uses time‐frequency information to identify and eliminate these “apparent” impacts. Finally, we apply the filter to four field calibration datasets and show that it significantly reduces site‐to‐site differences between calibration coefficients and enables the derivation of a single calibration curve for total bedload at all four sites.",

      "abstract": "Debris flows are among the most dangerous phenomena in mountain environment. Recently the use of seismic and infrasonic recordings has proven to be a powerful tool for studying and monitoring debris flows. However, open questions remain about how signal characteristics refllect flow parameters and fluid dynamic processes. We present a seismo‐acoustic analysis of the debris flow activity between 2017 and 2019 at the Illgraben catchment (Switzerland). Seismic and infrasonic amplitudes (maximum root mean square amplitude [RMSA]) and peak frequencies are compared with flow measurements (front velocity, maximum flow depth and density). Front velocity, maximum depth, peak discharge and peak mass flux show a positive correlation with both infrasonic and seismic maximum RMSA, suggesting that seismo‐acoustic amplitudes are influenced by these flow parameters. Comparison between seismo‐acoustic peak frequencies and flow parameters reveals that, unlike seismic signals, characterized by a constant peak frequency regardless of the magnitude of the flow, infrasound peak frequency decreases with increasing flow velocity, depth and discharge. Our results suggest that infrasound and seismic waves are generated by different source processes, acting at the flow free surface and at the channel bed respectively. We propose that infrasound is likely generated by waves and oscillations that develop at the surface of the flow, which, according to fluid dynamics, are mostly generated wherever the flow encounters significant channel irregularities. Furthermore, the observed positive correlations between seismo‐acoustic signal features and flow parameters highlight the potential to use infrasound and seismic measurements for debris‐flow monitoring and risk management.",

      "abstract": "Inversion of low‐frequency regional seismic records to solve for a time series of bulk forces exerted on the earth by a landslide (a force‐time function) is increasingly being used to infer volumes and dynamics of large, highly energetic landslides, such as rock avalanches and flowslides, and to provide calibration information on event dynamics and volumes for numerical landslide runout models. Much of the work to date using landslide runout modeling constrained by seismic data has focused on using single‐phase models with frictional or velocity‐weakening rheologies. Awareness of multistage landslide initiations is increasing, with discrete failures separated in time contributing to the final impact of an event. Our work utilizes a method for incorporating seismic data as a calibration constraint for landslide runout models, considering variable rheologies and different initiation conditions. This study presents a systematic examination of multiple rheologies and initiation conditions, and shows how these factors affect the force‐time function derived from the landslide runout model. Our work confirms that, while rheology and fragmenting or initially coherent initiations affect the force‐time function, multiple collapses separated by tens of seconds have the greatest impact on the shape and amplitude. We apply this method to the analysis of three real rock avalanches to better constrain plausible initiation conditions and rheology parameters using both seismic and field data. This study provides insights on how assumptions about the initiation dynamics of the source zone and the runout model definition can aid in the interpretation of seismic inversions for multistage rock avalanches.",

      "abstract": "Understanding seismic tremor wavefields can shed light on the complex functioning of a volcanic system and, thus, improve volcano monitoring systems. Usually, several seismic stations are required to detect, characterize, and locate volcanic tremors, which can be difficult in remote areas or low-income countries. In these cases, alternative techniques have to be used. Here, we apply a data-reduction approach based on the analysis of three-component seismic data from two co-located stations operating in different times to detect and analyze long-duration tremors. We characterize the spectral content and the polarization of 355 long-duration tremors recorded by a seismic sensor located 9.5 km SE from the active vent of Copahue volcano in the period 2012–2016 and 2018–2019. We classified them as narrow- (NB) and broad-band (BB) tremors according to their spectral content. Several parameters describe the characteristic peaks composing each NB episode: polarization degree, rectilinearity, horizontal azimuth, vertical incidence. Moreover, we propose two coefficients $$C_P$$ C P and $$C_L$$ C L for describing to what extent the wavefield is polarized. For BB episodes, we extend these attributes and express them as a function of frequency. We compare the occurrence of NB and BB episodes with the volcanic activity (including the level of the crater lake, deformation, temperature, and explosive activity) to get insights into their mechanisms. This comparison suggests that the wavefield of NB tremors becomes more linearly polarized during eruptive episodes, but does not provide any specific relationship between the tremor frequency and volcanic activity. On the other hand, BB tremors show a seasonal behavior that would be related to the activity of the shallow hydrothermal system. Graphical Abstract",

The high-Arctic\nlocation in the Svalbard archipelago makes SPITS an ideal laboratory for the\nstudy of cryoseisms, a nontectonic class of seismic events caused by freeze\nprocesses in ice, ice–soil, and ice–rock materials. We extracted a catalog\nof > 100 000 events from the nearly continuous observation period\nbetween 2004 and 2021, characterized by short-duration ground shaking of\njust a few seconds. This catalog contains two main subclasses where one\nsubclass is related to underground coal-mining activities and the other is\ninferred to be dominated by frost quakes resulting from thermal-contraction\ncracking of ice wedges and crack-filling vein ice. This inference is\nsupported by the correspondence between peaks in observed seismicity with\npeaks in modeled ground thermal stress, based on a Maxwellian\nthermo-viscoelastic model constrained by borehole observations of ground\ntemperature. The inferred frost quakes appear to be dominated by surface\nwave energy and SPITS proximal source positions, with three main areas that\nare associated with dynamic geomorphological features, i.e., erosional\nscarps and a frozen-debris/solifluction lobe.

Seismic signals produced by two local earthquakes, two teleseisms, and three debris flows detected by the seismometer in 2013 and 2014 were discussed. The seismic signal frequencies of the local earthquakes and teleseisms (both approximately 1800 km apart) were 0.3–30 and <1 Hz, respectively. Moreover, seismometer measurements revealed that seismic signals generated by debris flows can have minimum frequencies as low as 2 Hz. Time-matched CCD camera images revealed that debris flow surge fronts with larger rocks have lower minimum frequencies.

Constraining temporal changes of subsurface shear wave velocity (VS) can provide useful information to all these topics and the growing field of hydrological monitoring with seismic velocity. Using borehole records at Garner Valley, CA, we estimate seasonal subsurface VS variations from impulse response functions (IRFs) of earthquake data (2005–2018) along with IRFs and cross‐correlation of cross‐hole experiment data (2015–2018). The inferred VS variations are up to ∼25% in the top 6 m and ∼10% at 2–5 m in depth. The VS variations correlate strongly with the water table depth changes, suggesting that the changes are mostly due to fluctuations of pore pressure in the shallow material. The shallow velocity changes alter the near‐surface conditions, can affect seismic hazard estimation, and may be improperly attributed to deeper processes without careful analysis.",

However, such signals are dominated by low‐frequency surface waves that are not ideal for detecting changes associated with small tectonic processes. Here we show that it is possible to extract stable, high‐frequency body waves using seismic tremors generated by freight trains. Such body waves allow us to focus on small velocity perturbations in the crust with high spatial resolution. We report on 10 years of seismic velocity temporal changes at the San Jacinto Fault. We observe and map a two‐month‐long episode of velocity changes with complex spatial distribution and interpret the velocity perturbation as produced by a previously undocumented slow‐slip event. We verify the hypothesis through numerical simulations and locate this event along a fault segment believed to be locked. Such a slow‐slip event stresses its surroundings and may trigger a major earthquake on a fault section approaching failure.",

      "abstract": "The heterogeneity of the fractured-basalt and interbedded-sediment aquifer along the eastern margin of the Columbia Plateau Regional Aquifer System has presented challenges to resource managers in quantifying recharge and estimating sustainable withdrawals. Previous studies indicated recharge pathways in alluvial sediments atop a mountain–front interface upgradient of the basalt flows. In this sedimentary zone, six seismic stations were deployed for one year to detect velocity changes in low-frequency seismic waves that could be correlated to changes in groundwater recorded by a well transducer near the center of the seismic station network. Waveforms in the 1−5 Hz range were recorded at each station to determine changes in wave velocities between station pairs and correlate these velocity changes to changes in groundwater levels. The velocity–groundwater relation allowed for estimation of daily groundwater levels beneath the seismic station network. Existing hydrogeologic information was used to estimate hydraulic gradients and hydraulic conductivities, which allowed for the calculation of the daily volume of recharge passing beneath the seismic stations and into the confined aquifer system. The daily recharge volumes across the seismic station network were summed for comparison of the total annual recharge calculated from the change in seismic wave velocities (154,660 m3) to a flow model calculation of recharge based on areal precipitation and infiltration (26,250 m3). The 6× greater recharge estimated from the seismic wave velocity changes for this portion of the recharge zone is attributed to preferential pathways of high hydraulic conductivity and greater depth associated with paleochannels beneath the seismic station network.",

      "abstract": "Abstract. There are on average 35 fatal mountaineering accidents per summer in France. On average, since 1990, 3.7 of them have occurred every summer in the Grand Couloir du Goûter, on the classic route up Mont Blanc (4809 m a.s.l.). Rockfall is one of the main factors that explain this high accident rate and contribute to making it one of the most accident-prone areas in the Alps for mountaineers. In this particular context, the objective of this study is to document the rockfall activity and its triggering factors in the Grand Couloir du Goûter in order to disseminate the results to mountaineers and favour their adaptation to the local rockfall hazard. Using a multi-method monitoring system (five seismic sensors, an automatic digital camera, three rock subsurface temperature sensors, a traffic sensor, a high-resolution topographical survey, two weather stations and a rain gauge), we acquired a continuous database on rockfalls during a period of 68 d in 2019 and some of their potential triggering factors (precipitation, ground and air temperatures, snow cover, frequentation by climbers). At the seasonal scale, our results confirm\nprevious studies showing that rockfalls are most frequent during the\nsnowmelt period in permafrost-affected rockwalls. Furthermore, the\nunprecedented time precision and completeness of our rockfall database at\nhigh elevation thanks to seismic sensors allowed us to investigate the factors triggering rockfalls. We found a clear correlation between rockfall frequency and air temperature, with a 2 h delay between peak air temperature and peak rockfall activity. A small number of rockfalls seem to be triggered by mountaineers. Our data set shows that climbers are not aware of the variations in rockfall frequency and/or cannot/will not adapt their behaviour to this hazard. These results should help to define an adaptation strategy for climbers. Therefore, we disseminated our results within the mountaineering community thanks to the full integration of our results into the management of the route by local actors. Knowledge built during this experiment has already been used for the definition and implementation of management measures for the attendance in summer 2020.\n",

      "abstract": "\n The stability of the low-frequency peaks (< 1 Hz) obtained in the passive seismic survey of Campo de Dalías basin (CDB) by applying the horizontal-to-vertical spectral ratio (HVSR) method was investigated. Three temporary seismic stations were installed in remote sites that enabled studying the stationarity of their characteristic microtremor HVSR (MHVSR) shapes. All stations began to operate in mid-2016 and recorded at least one year of continuous seismic ambient noise data, having up to two years in some. Each seismic station counted with a monitored borehole in their vicinity, registering the groundwater level every 30 minutes. The MHVSR curves were calculated for time windows of 150 s and averaged hourly. Four parameters have been defined to characterize the shape of the MHVSR around the main peak and to compare them with several environmental variables. Correlations between MHVSR characteristics and the groundwater level showed to be the most persistent. The robustness of MHVSR method for applications to seismic engineering was not found to be compromised since the observed variations were within the margins of acceptable deviations. Our results widen the possibilities of the MHVSR method from being a reliable predictor for seismic resonance to also being an autonomous monitoring tool, especially sensitive to the S-wave modifications.",

      "abstract": "On 7 February 2021, Chamoli district (Uttarakhand, India) was devastated by a deadly rock-ice avalanche that led to a large causality of more than 200 people and a huge economic loss. We found noteworthy sequence of precursory signals of main failure/detachment preceded by a dynamic nucleation phase. The rock-ice avalanche appears to have been initiated by seismic precursors which were continuously active for 2:30 h prior to main detachment. The seismic amplitude, frequency characteristics and signal-to-noise ratio variation of detected tremors indicate static to dynamic changes in nucleation phase located at the source of detached wedge. The characteristics of seismic data distinguished debris flow and hitting obstacles from other seismic sources and allowed the estimations of debris flow speed. We analyzed and verified the seismic signals with field evidences to estimate the associated impacts and velocity of dynamic flow. The proximal high-quality seismic data allowed us to reconstruct the complete chronological sequence and evaluate impacts since the initiation of nucleation phase to its advancement. Furthermore, we suggest that real-time seismic monitoring with existing network and future deployment of integrated dense network can be used for forecasting of flow events and hazard mitigation in the downstream.",

      "abstract": "Deformation mechanisms of glaciers are highly sensitive to basal temperature; the motion of temperate glaciers is dominated by basal slip while cold‐based glaciers deform mainly by internal creep. While basal slip is usually aseismic, unstable slip sometimes occurs and can be detected by seismometers. I have detected clusters of repeating low‐frequency icequakes (LFIs) in the Mont‐Blanc massif. Some properties of LFIs are similar to the high‐frequency icequakes (HFIs) located at the base of Argentière glacier (Helmstetter, Nicolas, et al., 2015, https://doi.org/10.1002/2014jf003288). Both HFIs and LFIs occur as bursts of tens to several thousand events lasting for days or weeks, with typical inter‐event times of several minutes during bursts. Unlike HFIs that have a broad spectra, LFIs have a characteristic frequency of about 5 Hz at all stations, suggesting a rupture length of about 100 m. Seismic amplitudes and seismic waveforms of LFIs progressively evolve with time within each cluster, suggesting changes in either rupture length or rupture velocity. Most LFIs are detected during snowfall episodes while HFIs are not correlated with snowfall episodes. In this study, I used all available seismic stations within or around the Mont‐Blanc massif between 2017 and 2022. I found LFIs located all over the massif but mainly above 3,000 m. Some clusters are clearly associated with cold basal ice (near Mont‐Blanc summit) while others below 2,700 m a.s.l. are likely located under temperate glaciers and two clusters could be associated with landslides. This observation of LFIs on cold glaciers is consistent with laboratory friction experiments suggesting that cold ice promotes unstable slip (McCarthy et al., 2017, https://doi.org/10.1098/rsta.2015.0348; Saltiel et al., 2021, https://doi.org/10.1785/0220200480; Zoet et al., 2013, 2020, https://doi.org/10.1002/jgrf.20052, https://doi.org/10.1029/2020gl088964).",

The research identifies LFI clusters throughout the massif, primarily at higher altitudes. A key finding is that most LFIs correlate with snowfall events, unlike high-frequency icequakes. The observation of LFIs on cold glaciers may support the idea that cold ice facilitates unstable slip.",

      "abstract": "Rock glaciers are receiving increased attention as a potential source of water and indicator of climate change in periglacial landscapes. They consist of an ice‐debris mixture, which creeps downslope. Although rock glaciers are a wide‐spread feature on the Tibetan Plateau, characteristics such as its ice fraction are unknown as a superficial debris layer inhibits remote assessments. We investigate one rock glacier in the semiarid western Nyainqêntanglha range (WNR) with a multi‐method approach, which combines geophysical, geological and geomorphological field investigations with remote sensing techniques. Long‐term kinematics of the rock glacier are detected by 4‐year InSAR time series analysis. The ice content and the active layer are examined by electrical resistivity tomography, ground penetrating radar, and environmental seismology. Short‐term activity (11‐days) is captured by a seismic network. Clast analysis shows a sorting of the rock glacier's debris. The rock glacier has three zones, which are defined by the following characteristics: (a) Two predominant lithology types are preserved separately in the superficial debris patterns, (b) heterogeneous kinematics and seismic activity, and (c) distinct ice fractions. Conceptually, the studied rock glacier is discussed as an endmember of the glacier—debris‐covered glacier—rock glacier continuum. This, in turn, can be linked to its location on the semiarid lee‐side of the mountain range against the Indian summer monsoon. Geologically preconditioned and glacially overprinted, the studied rock glacier is suggested to be a recurring example for similar rock glaciers in the WNR. This study highlights how geology, topography and climate influence rock glacier characteristics and development.",

Traditional observations of subglacial hydrology are spatially and temporally limited, but recent seismic deployments on and around glaciers show the potential for comprehensive observation of glacial hydrologic systems. We present results from a high‐density seismic deployment spanning the surface of Lemon Creek Glacier, Alaska. Our study coincided with a marginal lake drainage event, which served as a natural experiment for seismic detection of changes in subglacial hydrology. We observed glaciohydraulic tremor across the surface of the glacier that was generated by the subglacial hydrologic system. During the lake drainage, the relative changes in seismic tremor power and water flux are consistent with pressurization of the subglacial system of only the upper part of the glacier. This event was not accompanied by a significant increase in glacier velocity; either some threshold necessary for rapid basal motion was not attained, or, plausibly, the geometry of Lemon Creek Glacier inhibited speedup. This pressurization event would have likely gone undetected without seismic observations, demonstrating the power of cryoseismology in testing assumptions about and mapping the spatial extent of subglacial pressurization.",

      "abstract": "\n Nenana basin in central Alaska is a long (90 km), narrow (12 km), and deep (7 km) sedimentary basin aligned with an active fault zone producing Mw≥6 earthquakes. From 2015 to 2019, 13 broadband seismic stations were deployed in the region as part of the Fault Locations and Alaska Tectonics from Seismicity project. These stations recorded a wide range of earthquakes, including Mw 3–4 directly below the basin as well as several regional earthquakes Mw>6. These 43 local and regional earthquakes, in addition to five teleseismic events and continuously recorded ambient noise, provide a data set that we use to quantify the response of Nenana basin to the seismic wavefield. We calculate spectral ratios between each station and a bedrock reference station for 48 earthquakes. We find amplification of 11–14 dB (amplification ratio 3.5–5.0) for low frequencies (0.1–0.5 Hz), and 8–15 dB (amplification ratio 2.5–5.6) for high frequencies (0.5–4.0 Hz) on the vertical component. At low frequencies, amplification of the earthquake wavefield agrees well with amplification of seismic noise, with both data sets exhibiting stronger amplification on the horizontal components, in comparison with the vertical component. Furthermore, stations overlying the deeper part of the basin exhibit stronger amplification, whereas stations at the margin of the basin exhibit minimal low-frequency amplification. At higher frequencies, amplification occurs at both deeper basin stations and also marginal basin stations. Our study establishes a catalog of diverse events for future theoretical and numerical studies that can use Nenana basin to better understand the complex influence of sedimentary basins on the seismic wavefield.",

Researchers analyzed data from 48 earthquakes recorded by seismic stations within the basin. The results showed notable amplification of seismic waves at both low and high frequencies.

      "abstract": "Shallow earthquakes frequently disturb the hydrological and mechanical state of the subsurface, with consequences for hazard and water management. Transient post‐seismic hydrological behavior has been widely reported, suggesting that the recovery of material properties (relaxation) following ground shaking may impact groundwater fluctuations. However, the monitoring of seismic velocity variations associated with earthquake damage and hydrological variations are often done assuming that both effects are independent. In a field site prone to highly variable hydrological conditions, we disentangle the different forcing of the relative seismic velocity variations δv retrieved from a small dense seismic array in Nepal in the aftermath of the 2015 Mw 7.8 Gorkha earthquake. We successfully model transient damage effects by introducing a universal relaxation function that contains a unique maximum relaxation timescale for the main shock and the aftershocks, independent of the ground shaking levels. Next, we remove the modeled velocity from the raw data and test whether the corresponding residuals agree with a background hydrological behavior we inferred from a previously calibrated groundwater model. The fitting of the δv data with this model is improved when we introduce transient hydrological properties in the phase immediately following the main shock. This transient behavior, interpreted as an enhanced permeability in the shallow subsurface, lasts for ∼6 months and is shorter than the damage relaxation (∼1 yr). Thus, we demonstrate the capability of seismic interferometry to deconvolve transient hydrological properties after earthquakes from non‐linear mechanical recovery.",
      "summary": "This study investigates changes in subsurface seismic velocity after the 2015 Gorkha earthquake in Nepal. The researchers aimed to separate the effects of earthquake damage and groundwater changes on seismic velocity. They modeled transient damage effects using a relaxation function and then analyzed residual velocity variations in relation to groundwater behavior. The results suggest a period of enhanced permeability in the shallow subsurface following the earthquake, shorter than the damage relaxation timescale.",

      "abstract": "\n A change in surface loading causes the Earth’s surface to deform. Mass movements, such as debris flows, can cause a tilt large enough to be recorded by nearby instruments, but the signal is strongly dependent on the mass loading and subsurface parameters. Specifically designed sensors for such measurements (tiltmeters) are cumbersome to install. Alternatively, broadband seismometers record translational motion and also tilt signals, often at periods of tens to hundreds of seconds. Their horizontal components are thereby the most sensitive to tilt. In this study, we show how to obtain tilt caused by the passing by of debris flows from seismic measurements recorded within tens of meters of the flow and investigate the usefulness of this signal for flow characterization. We investigate the problem on three scales (1) large-scale laboratory experiments at the U.S. Geological Survey debris-flow flume, where broadband seismometers and tiltmeters were installed for six 8–10  m3 experiments, (2) the Illgraben torrent in Switzerland, one of the most active mass wasting sites in the European Alps, where a broadband seismometer placed within a few meters of the channel recorded 15 debris-flow events with volumes up to 105  m3, and (3) Volcán de Fuego, Guatemala, where a broadband seismometer recorded two lahars. We investigate how the tilt signals compare to debris-flow parameters such as mean normal stresses, usually measured by expensive force plates, and debris-flow height. We model the elastic ground deformation as the response of an elastic half-space to a moving surface load. In addition, we use the model with some simplifications to determine the maximum debris-flow heights of Volcán de Fuego events, where no force plate measurements are available. Finally, we address how and under what assumptions the relatively affordable and straightforward tilt measurements may be utilized to infer debris-flow parameters, as opposed to force plates and other complicated instrument setups.",

      "abstract": "Sediment flows generate ground vibrations by exerting force fluctuations on the riverbed. Linking force fluctuations to properties of highly concentrated sediment flows, however, remains particularly challenging due to complexities arising from grain‐to‐grain interactions. Here, we conduct downscaled flume experiments in which we specifically measure force fluctuations and local seismic vibrations together with flow properties of highly concentrated sediment flows at high spatial and temporal resolution. We observe hysteresis behaviors between force fluctuations amplitude and flow surface elevation and mass that occur during complex changes in internal flow dynamics. By contrast, force fluctuations amplitude exhibits a unique negative relationship with solid concentration. We suggest this is due to the rheology of dense granular flows, where solid concentration is a proxy for particle agitation. We therefore advance that solid concentration should be incorporated in seismic models of such sediment flows as a key parameter describing inter‐particle collisions and impacts to the bed.",

      "abstract": "Future missions carrying seismometer payloads to icy ocean worlds will measure global and local seismicity to determine where the ice shell is seismically active. We use two locations, a seismically active site on Gulkana Glacier, Alaska, and a more seismically quiet site on the northwestern Greenland Ice Sheet as geophysical analogs. We compare the performance of a single‐station seismometer against a small‐aperture seismic array to detect both high (>1 Hz) and low (<0.1 Hz) frequency events at each site. We created catalogs of high frequency (HF) and low frequency (LF) seismicity at each location using an automated short‐term average/long‐term average technique. We find that with a 1‐m small‐aperture seismic array, our detection rate increased (9% for Alaska and 46% for Greenland) over the single‐station approach. At Gulkana, we recorded an order of magnitude greater HF events than the Greenland site. We ascribe the HF events sources to a combination of icequakes, rockfalls, and ice‐water interactions, while very HF events are determined to result from bamboo poles that were used to secure gear. We further find that local environmental noise reduces the ability to detect LF global tectonic events. Based upon this study, we recommend that (a) future missions consider the value of the expanded capability of a small array compared to a single station, (b) design detection algorithms that can accommodate variable environmental noise, and (c) assess the potential landings sites for sources of local environmental noise that may limit detection of global events.",

      "abstract": "Abstract. Substantial uncertainties in bedload transport predictions in steep streams have triggered intensive efforts to develop surrogate monitoring technologies. One such system, the Swiss plate geophone (SPG), has been deployed and calibrated in numerous steep water courses, mainly in the Alps. Calibration relationships linking the signal recorded by the SPG system to the transported bedload can vary substantially between different monitoring stations, likely due to site-specific factors such as the flow velocity and the bed roughness. Furthermore, recent controlled experiments have shown that site-specific calibration relationships can be biased by elastic waves resulting from impacts occurring outside the plate boundaries. Motivated by these findings, here we present a hybrid calibration procedure derived from flume experiments and an extensive dataset of 308 calibration measurements from four different field monitoring stations. Our main goal is to investigate the feasibility of a general, site-independent calibration procedure for inferring fractional bedload transport from the SPG signal. First, we use flume experiments to show that sediment size classes can be distinguished more accurately using a combination of vibrational frequency and amplitude information than by using amplitude information alone. Second, we apply this amplitude-frequency method to field measurements to derive general calibration coefficients for ten different grain-size fractions. The amplitude-frequency method results in more homogeneous signal responses across all sites and significantly improves the accuracy of fractional sediment flux and grain-size estimates. We attribute the remaining site-to-site discrepancies to large differences in flow velocity, and discuss further factors that may influence the accuracy of these bedload estimates.\n",

In a context where traditional monitoring techniques for fluvial processes often do not provide data with adequate temporal and spatial resolution, the use of dense arrays could allow the identification and tracking of different sources of river-induced seismic ground vibrations (e.g. turbulence and bedload transport). Here, we study the potential of dense seismic array monitoring by investigating a high-flow event that occurred in summer 2019 along a 600-m-long braided reach of the Séveraisse River (French Alps). We use a network of 80 seismometers deployed on both river banks, and we supplement the seismic observations with flow gauging measurements and time-lapse imagery. During this event, we observe impulsive signals that are coherently detected over the array, and which we interpret as being associated with the bedload transport of clusters of coarse grains (blocks). Through phase-delay analysis we are able to locate these seismic events on the bend apex of an active branch of the reach. These results demonstrate the capability of such a method to locate bedload activity at high spatiotemporal resolution, providing crucial information for geomorphological investigations and natural risk management.",

      "abstract": "\n Recent work in the field of cryo-seismology demonstrates that high-frequency (>1  Hz) seismic waves provide key constraints on a wide range of glacier processes, such as basal friction, surface crevassing, or subglacial water flow. Establishing quantitative links between the seismic signal and the processes of interest, however, requires detailed characterization of the wavefield, which, at high frequencies, necessitates the deployment of large and dense seismic arrays. Although dense seismic array monitoring has recently become increasingly common in geophysics, its application to glaciated environments remains limited. Here, we present a dense seismic array experiment made of 98 three-component seismic stations continuously recording during 35 days in early spring 2018 on the Argentière Glacier, French Alps. The seismic dataset is supplemented with a wide range of complementary observations obtained from ground-penetrating radar, drone imagery, Global Navigation Satellite Systems positioning, and in situ measurements of basal glacier sliding velocities and subglacial water discharge. We present first results through conducting spectral analysis, template matching, matched-field processing, and eikonal-wave tomography. We report enhanced spatial resolution on basal stick slip and englacial fracturing sources as well as novel constraints on the heterogeneous nature of the noise field generated by subglacial water flow and on the link between crevasse properties and englacial seismic velocities. We outline in which ways further work using this dataset could help tackle key remaining questions in the field.",

      "abstract": "Monitoring bedload transport is of interest for studying river morphology evolution and hydraulic structures stability (e.g., dams andbridges). Bedload self‐generated noise measured by hydrophones has been experimentally correlated to bedload flux in several studies. However, the lack of theoretical background linking the recorded acoustic noise to bedload and river characteristics has prevented a good understanding of the experimental results. Here, we develop a model of the acoustic noise generated by bedload transport in rivers. The model provides an estimation of the acoustic power generated by impacts of bedload particles with riverbed particles. In this model, we account for bedload kinematics (e.g., impact velocities, saltation length) and the environment in which acoustic wave is propagated (e.g., acoustic wave attenuation). Sensitivity analysis shows that the noise generated by bedload transport depends on the grain size distribution and river characteristics such as slope, water level, and propagation effects. We tested the model on a field data set comprising acoustic and direct bedload measurements from different rivers. The acoustic powers predicted by the model are consistent with field measurements for some rivers while questionable for other ones. The analysis has shown a great sensitivity of the model to bedload kinematics (in particular the way the grain velocity is computed) and riverbed grain size distribution. The model provides a first basis that can serve as a framework in future work concerned with acoustic measurements of bedload transport. However, the model is still imperfect and it is limited by today's knowledge of the physics of bedload transport.",

The ice cracks are detected and extracted, and Pearson correlation analysis between meteorological information and cracks is carried out.

Finally, the paper compares the experimental results with Arctic under-ice noise in the literature. Similarities with Arctic under-ice noise are observed in the experiment, including noise spectrum, cracks' peak frequency, and correlations between temperature and crack intensity. This paper believes that the study of under-ice noise in freshwater rivers can be used to simulate multi-year ice regions in the Arctic in terms of thermal-induced cracks and meteorological correlation.

A selected STA/LTA-type (short-term average/long-term average), or other, event detection algorithm can be applied to the waveforms and user-defined functions implemented to calculate any required characteristics of the detected events. The code is written in Python 2/3 and is available on GitHub together with detailed documentation and worked examples.",

      "abstract": "Quantifying debris‐flow characteristics remains a key challenge in natural hazard research. Recent studies suggest that seismic signals can reveal debris‐flow properties. However, the accuracy and applicability of theoretical models linking bulk flow properties to the seismic signature of a debris flow remain elusive. By extending a previously proposed model of random single‐particle impact forces to multi‐particle force chains acting on the channel bed, we describe the generation of high frequency seismic signals, and thereby estimate the bulk flow dynamics of six debris‐flow events at Illgraben, Switzerland. The theoretically predicted basal force fluctuations agree with in‐situ measurements at a basal force plate and seismic signals recorded adjacent to the channel. According to our model, both random single‐particle impacts and random impacts caused by multi‐particle force chains control basal force fluctuations. The relative contributions of single particles and of multi‐particle force chains may vary significantly for different events and different positions within events. The relative contribution of multi‐particle force chains is expected to be larger in the flow front, where particle concentrations are higher. The ratio between single‐particle and multi‐particle contributions appears to control the non‐linear relation between flow depth and the magnitude of the high frequency seismic signals. Our results suggest that fluctuating basal forces are strongly controlled by particle size and flow depth, and open new perspectives for the understanding of bulk flow characteristics, such as flow depth and weight, and of the high frequency seismic signals generated by debris flows.",

Cyclones (e.g., hurricanes, typhoons) and other atmospheric storms are efficient generators of high ocean waves that in turn generate distinct microseismic signatures. In this study, we perform a polarization (i.e., three‐component) beamforming analysis of microseismic (0.05–0.16 Hz) retrograde Rayleigh and Love waves during major Atlantic hurricanes using a virtual array of seismometers in Eastern Canada. Oceanic hindcasts and meteorological data are used for comparison. No continuous generation of microseism along the hurricane track is observed but rather an intermittent signal generation. Both seismic surface wave types show clear cyclone‐related microseismic signatures that are consistent with a colocated generation at near‐coastal or shallow regions, however the Love wavefield is comparatively less coherent. We identify two different kinds of intermittent signals: (a) azimuthally progressive signals that originate with a nearly constant spatial lag pointing toward the trail of the hurricanes and (b) azimuthally steady signals remaining nearly constant in direction of arrival even days after the hurricane significantly changed its azimuth. This high complexity highlights the need for further studies to unravel the interplay between site‐dependent geophysical parameters, SGW forcing at depth and microseismic wavefield radiation and propagation, as well as the potential use of cyclone microseisms as passive natural sources.",

Passive monitoring techniques permit investigation of interannual dependencies in bedload transport in high resolution, including sediment supply factors. Here, seismic impact plate records are processed using a probabilistic model BedLoad from Impact Plates model to derive a 5‐year bedload data set at 5‐min intervals for the lower River Avon, Devon, UK. For water years that range from very dry to very wet, annual coarse bedload yields are estimated to vary through two orders of magnitude with wide prediction intervals. The most effective discharge occurs consistently at about one‐third of bankfull flow, morphologically at “subbarfull” stage, the result of hysteretic trends and falling limb transport in this non‐threshold channel. A two‐phase sediment rating curve is revealed with a variable supply related “bulge” during in‐bank flows, giving way to a near‐linear trend during overbank flows. The supply related component is predicted well using a sensitivity style metric that combines the cumulative duration of competent flows with the magnitude‐duration product of near‐threshold flows, defining a field‐scale exemplar of “stress history.” Further, the relative proportion of supply related coarse bedload yield relates strongly to the relative wetness of the previous year. High resolution, multiyear data reveal that controls on bedload dynamics are unique to a site's hydrogeoclimatic context and position in the river basin.

      "abstract": "Abstract. On October 2, 2020, the Maritime Alps in southern France were struck by the devastating storm Alex that caused locally more than 600 mm of rain in less than 24 hours. The extreme rainfall and flooding destroyed regional rain and stream gauges. That hinders our understanding of the spatial and temporal dynamics of rainfall-runoff processes during the storm. Here, we show that seismological observations from permanent seismic stations constrain these processes at a catchment scale. The analysis of seismic power, peak frequency, and backazimuth provide us with the timing and velocity of the propagation of flash-flood waves associated with bedload-dominated phases of the flood on the Vésubie river. Moreover, the combined short-term average to long-term average ratio and template matching earthquake detection reveal that 114 local earthquakes between local magnitude ML = −0.5 and ML = 2 were triggered by the hydrological loading and/or the resulting in-situ underground pore pressure increase. This study shows the impact of storm Alex on the Earth’s surface and deep layer processes and paves the way to future works that can reveal further details of these processes.\n",

      "abstract": "\n Seismic shear wave velocity (S-velocity) shows a decrease towards the base of ice sheets in Antarctica and Greenland that is not accompanied by a corresponding decrease in compressional velocity (P-velocity). This decrease has been interpreted as arising from liquid water below the melting point (pre-melt water) at grain boundaries, but the lack of a corresponding decrease in P-velocity has not been explained. Representing grain boundaries as displacement discontinuities allows the change in P- and S-velocities to be written as functions of the normal and shear compliance of the grain boundaries. This allows the normal-to-shear compliance ratio of the grain boundaries to be constrained, and seismic anisotropy resulting from a partial orientation of grain boundaries to be estimated. This approach demonstrates that the observed reduction in S-velocity with no significant decrease in P-velocity near the base of ice sheets in Antarctica and Greenland can be explained by pre-melt water at small aperture grain boundaries. Such water may enable sliding along the grain boundaries and so may enhance creep of ice near the base of ice sheets. If stress state is anisotropic the aperture of water-containing grain boundaries may vary with azimuth, with the most open grain boundaries oriented with strikes perpendicular to least compressive stress. Microcracks and fractures may be treated also as displacement discontinuities and, together with oriented grain boundaries, may contribute to shear wave splitting as observed in West Antarctica in a fast-moving ice stream.",

      "abstract": "Ambient noise interferometry is a powerful technique to continuously measuring crustal seismic velocity changes (dv/v) and studying crustal behaviors over time. However, the interpretation of such dv/v variations is not straightforward since multiple causes including internal (tectonic/magmatic) processes of the crust and external (environmental) factors could both affect dv/v simultaneously. To differentiate the interplay between the internal and external processes in dv/v variations is an essential step toward accurate crustal monitoring. In this study, we apply the single‐station cross‐component (SC) method to 15 selected stations from the Broadband Array in Taiwan for Seismology (BATS) to investigate the temporal evolution of crustal seismic velocities across Taiwan. We process the continuous BATS seismic recording from 1998 to 2019, construct the daily SC correlation functions, and compute dv/v values by the stretching technique in a frequency band of 0.1–0.9 Hz. We observe both strong annual dv/v variations and co‐seismic velocity drops associated with regional moderate‐to‐large earthquakes. Systematic spectral and time‐series analyses with the weather data suggest that the rainfall‐induced pore‐pressure change plays a predominant role in driving the dv/v seasonality, reflecting a diffusion process from meteoric water into shallow crust. The effects of other factors are relatively local and secondary. We also demonstrate how understanding and correcting rainfall effects could critically improve the resolution and accuracy of internal crustal damage related to earthquakes.",

Previous work has shown that measurements of ground vibrations are capable of detecting the timing, speed, and location of debris flows. A remaining question is to what extent additional flow properties, such as grain‐size distribution and flow depth can be inferred reliably from seismic data. Here, we experimentally explore the relation of seismic vibrations and normal‐force fluctuations with debris‐flow composition and dynamics. We use a 5.4 m long and 0.3 m wide channel inclined at 20°, equipped with a geophone plate and force plate. We show that seismic vibrations and normal‐force fluctuations induced by debris flows are strongly correlated, and that both are affected by debris‐flow composition. We find that the effects of the large‐particle distribution on seismic vibrations and normal‐force fluctuations are substantially more pronounced than the effects of water fraction, clay fraction, and flow volume, especially when normalized by flow depth. We further show that for flows with similar coarse‐particle distributions seismic vibrations and normal‐force fluctuations can be reasonably well related to flow depth, even if total flow volume, water fraction, and the size distribution of fines varies. Our experimental results shed light on how changes in large‐particle, clay, and water fractions affect the seismic and force‐fluctuation signatures of debris flows, and provide important guidelines for their interpretation.",

This includes glaciers and ice sheets, whose fracture state controls the routing of water to the base and thus large-scale ice flow. Here we use anisotropy-induced shear wave splitting to characterize ice structure and probe subsurface water drainage beneath a seismometer network on an Alpine glacier. Shear wave splitting observations reveal diurnal variations in S-wave anisotropy up to 3%. Our modelling shows that when elevated by surface melt, subglacial water pressures induce englacial hydrofractures whose volume amounts to 1-2 percent of the probed ice mass. While subglacial water pressures decrease, these fractures close and no fracture-induced anisotropy variations are observed in the absence of meltwater. Consequently, fracture networks, which are known to dominate englacial water drainage, are highly dynamic and change their volumes by 90-180 % over subdaily time scales. Daily variations in seismic S-wave anisotropy reveal the dynamic response of englacial fractures to changing meltwater supply, according to shear wave splitting measurements from a seismometer network on the Rhonegletscher, Switzerland.",

      "abstract": "Abstract. In mountainous, cold temperate and polar sites, the presence of a snow cover can affect relative seismic velocity changes (dV/V) derived from ambient noise correlation, but this relation is relatively poorly documented and ambiguous. In this study, we analyzed raw seismic recordings from a snowy flat field site located above Davos (Switzerland), during one entire winter season (from December 2018 to June 2019). We identified three snowfall events with a substantial response of dV/V measurements (drops of several percent between 15 and 25 Hz), suggesting a detectable change in elastic properties of the medium due to the additional fresh snow. To better interpret the measurements, we used a physical model to compute frequency dependent changes in the Rayleigh wave velocity computed before and after the events. Elastic parameters of the ground subsurface were obtained from a seismic refraction survey, whereas snow cover properties were obtained from the snow cover model SNOWPACK. The decrease in dV/V due to a snowfall were well reproduced, with the same order of magnitude as observed values, confirming the importance of the effect of fresh and dry snow on seismic measurements. We also observed a decrease in dV/V with snowmelt periods, but we were not able to reproduce those changes with our model. Overall, our results highlight the effect of the snowcover on seismic measurements, but more work is needed to accurately model this response, in particular for the presence of liquid water in the snowpack.\n",

Using experiments with single grain sizes, we confirmed that increasing flow velocity reduces the signal response. Additionally, we performed mixed‐grain‐size experiments and found that the grain‐size distribution of the transported bedload can influence the signal response of the Swiss plate geophone system over more than one order of magnitude and lead to a biased estimation of the bedload flux.

However, investigations of suggested analogies between stick‐slip “icequakes” and earthquake faulting have been hampered by the noisy, melt‐prone and inaccessible nature of glacial environments. Here, we reveal details of stick‐slip events beneath an Alpine glacier using seismic sensors within a few meters of a seismically active bed region. We present evidence that widely detected stick‐slip events, which are measurable at the ice surface, are in fact dynamic ruptures over many smaller asperities, whose individual seismic failures are usually too small to be recorded at the surface. Characteristic recurrence times of such multi‐asperity ruptures and their sizes suggest an analogy to Parkfield earthquakes on the San Andreas Fault, questioning traditional glacier sliding theories. Although several trillion times smaller, glacial seismic sources presented here may therefore be ideal for studying earthquake faulting due to much higher event rates.",

      "abstract": "The fact that bedload transport is an inherently time‐variant and location‐sensitive fluvial process was revealed by systematic sampling, nine decades ago. Subsequent stream‐wide measurements, that frequently incorporated lengthy collection periods, as well as the adoption of standardized sampling procedures, averaged out some temporal and spatial variability. However, continuous, highly resolved, long‐period records of transport activity generated by active and passive bedload monitoring on diverse rivers have recently brought this variability into sharp focus. A defining characteristic of these ‘big data’ is that there are many possible bedload transport rates for each discharge and a wide range of discharges associated with each transport rate. Crucially, this incoherent scatter, which is generated by the various factors that affect bedload transport, can no longer be viewed as ‘noise’ that can be averaged out. We demonstrate that, even for small datasets, different methods of reporting and analysing bedload transport records provide different perspectives on the bedload transport rate–flow relation. The inclusion/exclusion of zero values, present in all data that capture the intermittent nature of bedload transport, also affects the relation. To unlock the potential of big data and facilitate the development of bedload transport–flow relations from field measurements, it is essential to employ modes of analysis that are robust to outliers and do not assume that associations between the independent and dependent variables are the same at all levels.",

      "abstract": "Bedload transport is a key process in fluvial morphodynamics, but difficult to measure. The advent of seismic monitoring techniques has provided an alternative to in‐stream monitoring, which is often costly and cannot be utilized during large floods. Seismic monitoring is a method requiring several steps to convert seismic data into bedload flux data. State‐of‐the‐art conversion approaches exploit physical models predicting the seismic signal generated by bedload transport. However, due to a lack of well‐constrained validation data, the accuracy of the resulting inversions is unknown. We use field experiments to constrain a seismic bedload model and compare the results to high‐quality independent bedload measurements. Constraining the Green's function (i.e., seismic ground properties) with an active seismic survey resulted in an average absolute difference between modeled and empirically measured seismic bedload power of 11 dB in the relevant frequency band. Using generically estimated Green's function parameters resulted in a difference of 20 dB, thus highlighting the importance of using actual field parameters. Water turbulence and grain hiding are unlikely to be the cause of differences between field observations and our analysis. Rather, they may be either due to the inverted model being particularly sensitive to the coarse tail of the grain‐size distribution, which is least well constrained from field observations, or due to the seismic model underestimating effects of the largest grains.",

Seismic waves produced by the source, which is called the accurately controlled routinely operated signal system (ACROSS), are recorded by three nearby seismic stations, and the travel time variation at each station is estimated using the transfer function calculated from the recorded data. Long-term variations in Vp and Vs are observed and can be interpreted by the change in fluid saturation and crack density of the subsurface rocks. The variation in fluid saturation and crack density are consistent with that in the groundwater level, which is measured at the station nearest to the ACROSS. Short-term responses to rainfalls are observed at the station nearest to the ACROSS system; the interpretation of the changes in crack density and saturation is inconsistent with the ground water observation, partly owing to the initial response to rainfall. This can be interpreted as an air–water mixture within pores or cracks on a fine scale.",

      "abstract": "An airgun source in a water reservoir has been developed in the past decade as a green active source that had been proven effective to derive short-term subsurface structural changes. However, seasonal water level fluctuation in the reservoir affects the airgun signal, and thus whether the airgun signals can be used to derive robust seasonal variation in subsurface structure remains unclear. We use the airgun data observed in the Binchuan basin to estimate the seasonal variation of seismic travel time and compare the results with those derived from ambient noise data in the same frequency band. Our main observation is that seasonal change δt/t from airgun is negatively correlated to the variation of dominant frequency and water table fluctuation in the reservoir. One possible explanation is that water table fluctuation in the reservoir affects the dominant frequency of the airgun signal and causes significant phase shift. We also compute the travel time changes in P-wave from the empirical Green’s function after deconvolving the waveforms from a reference station that is 50 m from the airgun source. The dominant frequency after deconvolution still shows seasonal variation and correlates inversely to the travel time changes, suggesting that deconvolution cannot completely eliminate the source effect on travel time changes. We also use ambient noise cross-correlation to retrieve coda waves and then derive travel time changes in monthly stacked cross-correlations relative to a yearly average cross-correlation. We observe that seismic travel time increases to its local maximum in the end of August. The travel time changes lag behind the precipitation for about one month. We apply a poroelastic physical model to explain seismic travel time changes and find that a combined effect from precipitation and evaporation might induce the seasonal changes as shown in the ambient noise data. However, the pattern of travel time changes from the airgun differs from that from ambient noise, reflecting the strong effects of airgun source property changes. Therefore, we should be cautious to derive long-term subsurface structural variation from the airgun source and put more attention on stabilizing the dominant frequency of each excitation in the future experiments.",

Airgun data from the Binchuan basin was used to estimate seasonal seismic travel time variations. The research found a negative correlation between travel time changes and water table fluctuation.

We incorporate constraints on the seismic source from laboratory studies of calving and test multiple source time functions using synthetic and observed glacial‐earthquake waveforms. We find that a simple, fixed time function with a shape informed by laboratory results greatly improves estimates of earthquake size. The average ratio of estimated to true peak force values is 1.03 for experiments using our preferred source model, compared with an average of 0.3 for models used in previous studies. We find that maximum‐force values estimated from waveform modeling depend far less on model choices than does MCSF, and therefore prefer maximum force as a measure of glacial‐earthquake size. Using both synthetic and real data, we confirm a correlation between maximum force and iceberg mass. Our results support the possibility of developing useful scaling relationships between seismic observables and physical parameters controlling glacier calving.",

      "abstract": "Abstract. Among mountainous permafrost landforms, rock glaciers are mostly\nabundant in periglacial areas, as tongue-shaped heterogeneous bodies.\nPassive seismic monitoring systems have the potential to provide continuous\nrecordings sensitive to hydro-mechanical parameters of the subsurface. Two\nactive rock glaciers located in the Alps (Gugla, Switzerland, and Laurichard,\nFrance) have been instrumented with seismic networks. Here, we analyze\nthe spectral content of ambient noise to study the modal sensitivity of rock\nglaciers, which is directly linked to the system's elastic properties. For\nboth sites, we succeed in tracking and monitoring resonance frequencies of\nspecific vibrating modes of the rock glaciers over several years. These\nfrequencies show a seasonal pattern characterized by higher frequencies at\nthe end of winters and lower frequencies in warm periods. We interpret\nthese variations as the effect of the seasonal freeze–thawing cycle on\nelastic properties of the medium. To assess this assumption, we model both\nrock glaciers in summer, using seismic velocities constrained by active\nseismic acquisitions, while bedrock depth is constrained by ground-penetrating radar surveys. The variations in elastic properties occurring in\nwinter due to freezing were taken into account thanks to a three-phase\nBiot–Gassmann poroelastic model, where the rock glacier is considered a\nmixture of a solid porous matrix and pores filled by water or ice. Assuming\nrock glaciers to be vibrating structures, we numerically compute the modal\nresponse of such mechanical models by a finite-element method. The resulting\nmodeled resonance frequencies fit well the measured ones over seasons,\nreinforcing the validity of our poroelastic approach. This seismic\nmonitoring allows then a better understanding of the location, intensity and\ntiming of freeze–thawing cycles affecting rock glaciers.",

      "abstract": "\n The theory of Green’s function retrieval essentially requires homogeneously distributed noise sources. Even though these conditions are not fulfilled in nature, low-frequency (<1 Hz) surface waves generated by ocean-crust interactions have been used successfully to image the crust with unprecedented spatial resolution. In contrast to low-frequency surface waves, high-frequency (>1 Hz) body waves have a sharper, more localized sensitivity to velocity contrasts and temporal changes at depth. In general, their retrieval using seismic interferometry is challenging, and recent studies focus on powerful, localized noise sources. They have proven to be a promising alternative but break the assumptions of Green’s function retrieval. In this study, we present an approach to model correlations between P waves for these scenarios and analyze their sensitivity to 3D Earth structure. We perform a series of numerical experiments to advance our understanding of these signals and prepare for an application to fault monitoring. In the considered cases, the character of the signals strongly diverges from Green’s function retrieval, and the sensitivity to structure has significant contributions in the source direction. An accurate description of the underlying physics allows us to reproduce observations made in the context of monitoring the San Jacinto Fault in California using train-generated seismic waves. This approach provides new perspectives for detecting and localizing temporal velocity changes previously unnoticed by commonly exploited surface-wave reconstructions.",

      "abstract": "Abstract. In mountainous areas, rockfalls, rock avalanches, and debris flows constitute a risk to human life and property. Seismology has proven a useful tool to monitor such mass movements, while increasing data volumes and availability of real-time data streams demand new solutions for automatic signal classification. Ideally, seismic monitoring arrays have large apertures and record a significant number of mass movements to train detection algorithms. However, this is rarely the case, as a result of cost and time constraints and the rare occurrence of catastrophic mass movements. Here, we use the supervised random forest algorithm to classify windowed seismic data on a continuous data stream. We investigate algorithm performance for signal classification into noise (NO), slope failure (SF), and earthquake (EQ) classes and explore the influence of non-ideal though commonly encountered conditions: poor network coverage, imbalanced data sets, and low signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). To this end we use data from two separate locations in the Swiss Alps: data set (i), recorded at Illgraben, contains signals of several dozen slope failures with low SNR; data set (ii), recorded at Pizzo Cengalo, contains only five slope failure events albeit with higher SNR. The low SNR of slope failure events in data set (i) leads to a classification accuracy of 70 % for SF, with the largest confusion between NO and SF. Although data set (ii) is highly imbalanced, lowering the prediction threshold for slope failures leads to a prediction accuracy of 80 % for SF, with the largest confusion between SF and EQ. Standard techniques to mitigate training data imbalance do not increase prediction accuracy. The classifier of data set (ii) is then used to train a model for the classification of 176 d of continuous seismic recordings containing four slope failure events. The model classifies eight events as slope failures, of which two are snow avalanches, and one is a rock-slope failure. The other events are local or regional earthquakes. By including earthquake detection of a permanent seismic station at 131 km distance to the test site into the decision-making process, all earthquakes falsely classified as slope failures can be excluded. Our study shows that, even for limited training data and non-optimal network geometry, machine learning algorithms applied to high-quality seismic records can be used to monitor mass movements automatically.",

      "abstract": "Microseismicity, induced by the sliding of a glacier over its bed, can be used to characterize frictional properties of the ice‐bed interface, which are a key parameter controlling ice stream flow. We use naturally occurring seismicity to monitor spatiotemporally varying bed properties at Rutford Ice Stream, West Antarctica. We locate 230,000 micro‐earthquakes with local magnitudes from −2.0 to −0.3 using 90 days of recordings from a 35‐station seismic network located ∼40 km upstream of the grounding line. Events exclusively occur near the ice‐bed interface and indicate predominantly flow‐parallel stick‐slip. They mostly lie within a region of interpreted stiff till and along the likely stiffer part of mega‐scale glacial lineations. Within these regions, micro‐earthquakes occur in spatially (<100 m radius) and temporally (mostly 1–5 days activity) restricted event‐clusters (up to 4,000 events), which exhibit an increase, followed by a decrease, in event magnitude with time. This may indicate event triggering once activity is initiated. Although ocean tides modulate the surface ice flow velocity, we observe little periodic variation in overall event frequency over time and conclude that water content, bed topography and stiffness are the major factors controlling microseismicity. Based on variable rupture mechanisms and spatiotemporal characteristics, we suggest the event‐clusters relate to three end‐member types of bed deformation: (1) continuous creation and seismogenic destruction of small‐scale bed‐roughness, (2) ploughed clasts, and (3) flow‐oblique deformation during landform formation or along bedrock outcrops. This indicates that multiple processes, simultaneously active during glacial sliding, can accommodate stick‐slip behavior and that the bed continuously reorganizes.",

      "abstract": "\n Temporal changes in subsurface properties, such as seismic wave speeds, can be monitored by measuring phase shifts in the coda of two seismic waveforms that share a similar source–receiver path but that are recorded at different times. These nearly identical seismic waveforms are usually obtained either from repeated earthquake waveforms or from repeated ambient noise cross-correlations. The five algorithms that are the most popular to measure phase shifts in the coda waves are the windowed cross correlation (WCC), trace stretching (TS), dynamic time warping (DTW), moving window cross spectrum (MWCS) and wavelet cross spectrum (WCS). The seismic wave speed perturbation is then obtained from the linear regression of phase shifts with their respective lag times under the assumption that the velocity perturbation is homogeneous between (virtual or active) source and receiver. We categorize these methods into the time domain (WCC, TS, DTW), frequency domain (MWCS) and wavelet domain (WCS). This study complements this suite of algorithms with two additional wavelet-domain methods, which we call wavelet transform stretching (WTS) and wavelet transform DTW, wherein we apply traditional stretching and DTW techniques to the wavelet transform. This work aims to verify, validate, and test the accuracy and performance of all methods by performing numerical experiments, in which the elastic wavefields are solved for in various 2-D heterogeneous half-space geometries. Through this work, we validate the assumption of a linear increase in phase shifts with respect to phase lags as a valid argument for fully homogeneous and laterally homogeneous velocity changes. Additionally, we investigate the sensitivity of coda waves at various seismic frequencies to the depth of the velocity perturbation. Overall, we conclude that seismic wavefields generated and recorded at the surface lose sensitivity rapidly with increasing depth of the velocity change for all source–receiver offsets. However, measurements made over a spectrum of seismic frequencies exhibit a pattern such that wavelet methods, and especially WTS, provide useful information to infer the depth of the velocity changes.",

      "abstract": "\n About 70% of Earth’s surface is covered by ocean, for which seismic observations are challenging. Seafloor seismology overcame this fundamental difficulty and radically transformed the earth sciences, as it expanded the coverage of seismic networks and revealed otherwise inaccessible features. At the same time, there has been a recent increase in the number of studies on cryoseismology. These have yielded multiple discoveries but are limited primarily to land and ice-surface receivers. Near ice calving fronts, such surface stations are noisy, primarily due to crevassing and wind, are hazardous to maintain, and can be lost due to iceberg calving. To circumvent these issues, we have applied ocean-bottom seismology to the calving front of a tidewater glacier in northwest Greenland. We present details of this experiment, and describe the technical challenges, noise analysis, and examples of recorded data. This includes tide-modulated seismicity with thousands of icequakes per day and the first near-source (∼200–640  m) underwater record of a major kilometer-scale calving event in Greenland, which generated a glacial earthquake that was detectable ∼420  km away. We also identified a decrease in bottom-water temperature, presumably due to modified water stratification driven by extreme Greenland glacial melting, at the end of July 2019. Importantly, we identify glacial sediments as the key reason for the anomalously long (∼9.7  hr) delay in the sensor release from the fjord seafloor. Our study demonstrates a methodology to undertake innovative, interdisciplinary, near-source studies on glacier basal sliding, calving, and marine-mammal vocalizations.",

This includes tide-modulated seismicity with thousands of icequakes per day and the first near-source (∼200–640  m) underwater record of a major kilometer-scale calving event in Greenland, which generated a glacial earthquake that was detectable ∼420  km away.",

      "abstract": "Shearing along subduction zones, laboratory experiments on analogue faults, and sliding along glacier beds are all associated with aseismic and co-seismic slip. In this study, an ocean-bottom seismometer is deployed near the terminus of a Greenlandic tidewater glacier, effectively insulating the signal from the extremely noisy surface seismic wavefield. Continuous, tide-modulated tremor related to ice speed is recorded at the bed of the glacier. When noise interference (for example, due to strong winds) is low, the tremor is also confirmed via analysis of seismic waveforms from surface stations. The signal resembles the tectonic tremor commonly observed during slow-earthquake events in subduction zones. We propose that the glacier sliding velocity can be retrieved from the observed seismic noise. Our approach may open new opportunities for monitoring calving-front processes in one of the most difficult-to-access cryospheric environments. Anomalously slow earthquakes play a critical role in the earthquake cycle and fault sliding. Here, the authors detect continuous seismic radiation from a glacier sliding over its bed and show persistent coastal shaking to represent an addition to the family of slow earthquakes.",

Here we present an analysis of two months of seismic data from Llaima volcano, Chile, recorded by the permanent monitoring network in 2019. We find over 2,000 repeating low-frequency events split across 82 families, the largest of which contains over 200 events. Estimated locations for the largest families indicate shallow sources directly beneath or near the edge of glaciers around the summit vent. These low-frequency earthquakes are part of an annual cycle in activity at the volcano that is strongly correlated with variations in atmospheric temperature, leading us to conclude that meltwater from ice and snow strongly affects the seismic source mechanisms which is likely dominated by basal slip beneath the glaciers. The results presented here should inform future assessments of eruptive potential at Llaima volcano, as well as other ice-covered volcanoes in Chile and worldwide.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Measurements of elastic wave velocities enable non-destructive estimation of the mechanical properties, elastic moduli and density of snow and firn. The variation of elastic moduli with porosity in dry snow and firn is modeled using a differential effective medium scheme modified to account for the critical porosity above which the bulk and shear moduli of the ice frame vanish. A comparison of predicted and measured elastic moduli indicates that the shear modulus of ice in snow is lower than that computed from single crystal elastic stiffnesses of ice. This may indicate that the bonds between snow particles are more deformable under shear than under compression. A partial alignment of ice crystals also may contribute. Good agreement between elastic stiffnesses of the ice frame obtained from elastic wave velocity measurements and the predictions of the theory is observed. The approach is simple and compact, and does not require the use of empirical fits to the data. Owing to its simplicity, this model may prove useful in a variety of potential applications such as construction on snow, interpretation of seismic measurements to monitor and locate avalanches and estimation of density within compacting snow deposited on glaciers and ice sheets.",

      "abstract": "The Seismic Experiment for Interior Structure (SEIS) of the InSight mission to Mars, has been providing direct information on Martian interior structure and dynamics of that planet since it landed. Compared to seismic recordings on Earth, ground motion measurements acquired by SEIS on Mars are made under dramatically different ambient noise conditions, but include idiosyncratic signals that arise from coupling between different InSight sensors and spacecraft components. This work is to synthesize what is known about these signal types, illustrate how they can manifest in waveforms and noise correlations, and present pitfalls in structural interpretations based on standard seismic analysis methods. We show that glitches, a type of prominent transient signal, can produce artifacts in ambient noise correlations. Sustained signals that vary in frequency, such as lander modes which are affected by variations in temperature and wind conditions over the course of the Martian Sol, can also contaminate ambient noise results. Therefore, both types of signals have the potential to bias interpretation in terms of subsurface layering. We illustrate that signal processing in the presence of identified nonseismic signals must be informed by an understanding of the underlying physical processes in order for high fidelity waveforms of ground motion to be extracted. While the origins of most idiosyncratic signals are well understood, the 2.4 Hz resonance remains debated and the literature does not contain an explanation of its fine spectral structure. Even though the selection of idiosyncratic signal types discussed in this paper may not be exhaustive, we provide guidance on best practices for enhancing the robustness of structural interpretations.",

      "abstract": "\n We examine regional transient changes of seismic velocities generated by the 2019 Mw 7.1 Ridgecrest earthquake in California, using autocorrelations of moving time windows in continuous waveforms recorded at regional stations. We focus on traveltime differences in a prominent phase generated by an interface around 2 km depth, associated with transmitted Pp waves and converted Ps waves from the ongoing microseismicity. Synthetic tests demonstrate the feasibility of the method for monitoring seismic velocity changes. Taking advantage of the numerous aftershocks in the early period following the main shock, we obtain a temporal resolution of velocity changes up to 20 min in the early post-main-shock period. The results reveal regional coseismic velocity drops in the top 1–3 km with an average value of ∼2 per cent over distances up to 100 km from the Ridgecrest event. These average velocity drops are likely dominated by larger changes in the shallow materials and are followed by rapid recoveries on timescales of days. Around the north end of the Ridgecrest rupture and the nearby Coso geothermal region, the observed coseismic velocity drops are up to ∼8 per cent. The method allows monitoring temporal changes of seismic velocities with high temporal resolution, fast computation and precise spatial mapping of changes. The results suggest that significant temporal changes of seismic velocities of shallow materials are commonly generated on a regional scale by large events.",

      "abstract": "\n The National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s (NASAs) Interior exploration using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport (InSight) lander successfully touched down on Mars in November 2018, and, for the first time, a seismometer was deployed on the surface of the planet. The seismic recordings reveal diurnal and seasonal changes of the broadband noise level that are consistent with variations of the local atmospheric conditions. The seismic data include a variety of spectral peaks, which are interpreted as wind-excited, mechanical resonances of the lander, resonances of the subsurface, or artifacts produced in the measurement system. Understanding the origin of these signals is critical for the detection and characterization of marsquakes as well as for studies investigating the ambient noise. We identify the major spectral peaks up to 9 Hz, corresponding to the frequency range the most relevant to observed marsquakes. We track the variations in frequency, amplitude, and polarization of these peaks over the duration of the mission so far. The majority of these peaks can readily be classified as measurement artifacts or lander resonances (lander modes), of which the latter have a temperature-dependent peak frequency and a wind-sensitive amplitude. Of particular interest is a prominent resonance at 2.4 Hz, which is used to discriminate between seismic events and local noise and is possibly produced by a subsurface structure. In contrast to the lander modes, the 2.4 Hz resonance has distinctly different features: (1) a broad and stable spectral shape, slightly shifted on each component; (2) predominantly vertical energy; (3) temperature-independent peak frequency; (4) comparatively weak amplification by local winds, though there is a slow change in the diurnal and seasonal amplitude; and (5) excitation during all seismic events that excite this frequency band. Based on these observations, we suggest that the 2.4 Hz resonance is the only mode below 9 Hz that could be related to a local ground structure.",
      "summary": "The InSight lander deployed a seismometer on Mars, recording seismic data with notable noise variations. This study focuses on identifying spectral peaks within the 1-9 Hz range present in the seismic data. Researchers classified these peaks as measurement artifacts, lander resonances, or potential subsurface resonances. Analysis suggests that a 2.4 Hz resonance may be linked to a local ground structure, differing from lander-related modes.",

      "abstract": "Landslides have caused extensive infrastructure damage and caused human fatalities for centuries. Intense precipitation and large earthquakes are considered to be two major landslide triggers, particularly in the case of catastrophic landslides. The most widely accepted mechanistic explanation for landslides is the effective-stress dependent shear strength reduction due to increases in pore water pressure. The Chashan landslide site, selected for the present study, has been intensively studied from geological, geophysical, geodetic, geotechnical, hydrological, and seismological perspectives. Our seismic monitoring of daily relative velocity changes (dv/v) indicated that landslide material decreases coincided with the first half of the rainy period and increased during the latter half of the rainy period. The geodetic surveys before and after the rainy period identified vertical subsidence without horizontal movement. The results from the multidisciplinary investigation enabled us to draw a conceptual model of the landslide recovery process induced by water loading. Where all sliding materials were stable (safety factor > 1.0), unconsolidated landslide colluvium and impermeable sliding surfaces trapped the seepage water to form a water tank, provided that compact forces were acting on the materials below the sliding boundary. The vertical force of compaction facilitates an increase in the cohesion and strength of landslide materials, thereby increasing the landslide materials’ stability. We demonstrated that the recovery process periodically occurs only under the combined conditions of prolonged and intense precipitation and the related stability conditions.",

      "abstract": "\n Following the installation of a temporary seismological network in western Greece north of the Gulf of Patras, we determined the quality of the sites of each of the 10 stations in the network. For this, we used the horizontal-to-vertical spectral ratio (HVSR) method and calculated an average curve over randomly selected days between 0 and 10 Hz. The daily HVSR curve is determined by the HVSR 12-hr calculation (1 hr every two) without distinction between seismic ambient noise and earthquake signal. The HVSR curves obtained can be classified in three categories: flat curves without amplification, curves with a amplification peaks covering a large frequency range, and curves with one or more narrow peaks. In this third category C3, one station has one peak, two have two and one has three. On the contrary of what it is commonly assumed, the amplitudes and the resonance frequencies of these narrow peaks are not stable over time in C3. We determined the maximum of the amplitude of each peak with the corresponding central frequency for each day during 2.5 yr. Except for the station with three peaks, which finally appears stable within the uncertainties, the principal peak exhibits a seasonal variation, with a maximum in winter and a minimum in summer, the observations being more dispersed during winter. The second peak, when it exists, varies in the same way except at one station where it varies oppositely. These variations are clearly correlated with the loading and unloading cycle of the underlying aquifers as shown by the comparison with water level and yield measurements from wells located close to the stations. Moreover, they are also correlated with the vertical surface displacements observed at continuously recording GPS stations. The dispersion of the observed maximum amplitude in winter is probably related to the rainfall and the soil moisture modifying the S-wave velocity as revealed by other studies. From this study, we would like to emphasize that the use the HVSR method to constrain the S-wave velocity and the thickness of the sediment layer over the bedrock in the basin, has to be done with caution. Upon further confirmation of its robustness, the HVSR methodology presented here could be a good and easy-to-use tool for a qualitative survey of the aquifer backdrop and its seasonal behaviour, and of the soil moisture conditions.",

      "abstract": "A new episode of unrest and phreatic/phreatomagmatic/magmatic eruptions occurred at Ambae volcano, Vanuatu, in 2017–2018. We installed a multi-station seismo-acoustic network consisting of seven 3-component broadband seismic stations and four 3-element (26–62 m maximum inter-element separation) infrasound arrays during the last phase of the 2018 eruption episode, capturing at least six reported major explosions towards the end of the eruption episode. The observed volcanic seismic signals are generally in the passband 0.5–10 Hz during the eruptive activity, but the corresponding acoustic signals have relatively low frequencies (< 1 Hz). Apparent very-long-period (< 0.2 Hz) seismic signals are also observed during the eruptive episode, but we show that they are generated as ground-coupled airwaves and propagate with atmospheric acoustic velocity. We observe strongly coherent infrasound waves at all acoustic arrays during the eruptions. Using waveform similarity of the acoustic signals, we detect previously unreported volcanic explosions at the summit vent region based on constant-celerity reverse-time-migration (RTM) analysis. The detected acoustic bursts are temporally related to shallow seismic volcanic tremor (frequency content of 5–10 Hz), which we characterise using a simplified amplitude ratio method at a seismic station pair with different distances from the vent. The amplitude ratio increased at the onset of large explosions and then decreased, which is interpreted as the seismic source ascent and descent. The ratio change is potentially useful to recognise volcanic unrest using only two seismic stations quickly. This study reiterates the value of joint seismo-acoustic data for improving interpretation of volcanic activity and reducing ambiguity in geophysical monitoring.",
      "summary": "This study examines the 2018 eruption of the Ambae volcano in Vanuatu. A seismo-acoustic network was used to capture seismic and acoustic signals during the eruption's final phase. Analysis of these signals revealed relationships between infrasound waves, volcanic tremor, and previously unreported explosions.

Controlled experiments were performed to investigate the acoustic signal response of the Swiss plate geophone (SPG) system impacted by bedload particles varying in size, impact angle and transport mode. The impacts of bedload particles moving by saltation, rolling, and sliding were determined by analyzing the experimental videos and corresponding vibration signals. For a particle impact on the bed or on the geophone plates, the signature of the generated signal in terms of maximum amplitude, number of impulses and centroid frequency was extracted from the raw monitoring data. So-called signal packets were determined by performing a Hilbert transform of the raw signal. The number of packets was calculated for each transport mode and for each particle size class, with sizes ranging from 28.1 mm to 171.5 mm. The results show how the number of signal impulses per particle mass, the amplitude of the signal envelope, and the centroid frequency change with increasing particle size, and they also demonstrate the effect of bedload transport mode on the signal response of the SPG system. We found that there is a general increase in the strength of the signal response or in the centroid frequency when the transport mode changes from sliding to rolling to saltation. The findings of this study help to better understand the signal response of the SPG system for different bedload transport modes, and may also contribute to an improvement of the procedure to determine bedload particle size from the SPG signal.\n",

Using standard array processing techniques, we compared the infrasound source back azimuths with the avalanche flow path identified by frame‐differenced, geo‐referenced video. Results show that infrasound records begin with direct arrivals followed by echoes from the avalanche‐triggering explosions and these decay within 35 s of the detonations. Subsequent infrasound, which lasts 20–30 s, could then be attributed exclusively to the avalanche. These infrasound detections, and their triangulated source locations, progress downhill over time and the most intense infrasound appears to originate from a steep, mid‐path cliff band, where the avalanche reached speeds in excess of 30 m/s and accelerations of more than 5 m/s2. The recorded infrasound was compared to two candidate source models extracted from video: total flow motion and advancing flow motion. Advancing source locations were compared to acoustic intensity time series using a nonnegative least squares inversion to solve for, and to quantify, time‐varying infrasound source intensity. We observed that certain portions of the flow, most notably the early stages and the end stages (when the powder cloud was expanding and settling) were infrasonically quiet.",

      "abstract": "The impact of permafrost thaw on hydrologic, thermal, and biotic processes remains uncertain, in part due to limitations in subsurface measurement capabilities. To better understand subsurface processes in thermokarst environments, we collocated geophysical and biogeochemical instruments along a thaw gradient between forested permafrost and collapse‐scar bogs at the Alaska Peatland Experiment site near Fairbanks, Alaska. Ambient seismic noise monitoring provided continuous high‐temporal resolution measurements of water and ice saturation changes. Maps of seismic velocity change identified areas of large summertime velocity reductions nearest the youngest bog, indicating potential thaw and expansion at the bog margin. These results corresponded well with complementary borehole nuclear magnetic resonance measurements of unfrozen water content with depth, which showed permafrost soils nearest the bog edges contained the largest amount of unfrozen water along the study transect, up to 25% by volume. In situ measurements of methane within permafrost soils revealed high concentrations at these bog‐edge locations, up to 30% soil gas. Supra‐permafrost talik zones were observed at the bog margins, indicating talik formation and perennial liquid water may drive lateral bog expansion and enhanced permafrost carbon losses preceding thaw. Comparison of seismic monitoring with wintertime surface carbon dioxide fluxes revealed differential responses depending on time and proximity to the bogs, capturing the controlling influence of subsurface water and ice on microbial activity and surficial emissions. This study demonstrates a multidisciplinary approach for gaining new understanding of how subsurface physical properties influence greenhouse gas production, emissions, and thermokarst development.",

      "abstract": "\n In anticipation of future spacecraft missions to icy ocean worlds, the Seismometer to Investigate Ice and Ocean Structure (SIIOS) was funded by National Aeronautics and Space Administration, to prepare for seismologic investigations of these worlds. During the summer of 2018, the SIIOS team deployed a seismic experiment on the Greenland ice sheet situated, approximately, 80 km north of Qaanaaq, Greenland. The seismometers deployed included one Trillium 120 s Posthole (TPH) broadband seismometer, 13 Silicon Audio flight-candidate seismometers, and five Sercel L28 4.5 Hz geophones. Seismometers were buried 1 m deep in the firn in a cross-shaped array centered on a collocated TPH and Silicon Audio instrument. One part of the array consisted of Silicon Audio and Sercel geophones situated 1 m from the center of the array in the ordinal directions. A second set of four Silicon Audio instruments was situated 1 km from the center of the array in the cardinal directions. A mock-lander spacecraft was placed at the array center and instrumented with four Silicon Audio seismometers. We performed an active-source experiment and a passive-listening experiment that lasted for, approximately, 12 days. The active–source experiment consisted of 9–12 sledgehammer strikes to an aluminum plate at 10 separate locations up to 100 m from the array center. The passive experiment recorded the ice-sheet ambient background noise, as well as local and regional events. Both datasets will be used to quantify differences in spacecraft instrumentation deployment strategies, and for evaluating science capabilities for single-station and small-aperture seismic arrays in future geophysical missions. Our initial results indicate that the flight-candidate seismometer performs comparably to the TPH at frequencies above 0.1 Hz and that instruments coupled to the mock-lander perform comparably to ground-based instrumentation in the frequency band of 0.1–10 Hz. For future icy ocean world missions, a deck-coupled seismometer would perform similarly to a ground-based deployment across the most frequency bands.",

These measurements, high‐resolution bathymetry, and abundant contextual information make the DONET region seem ideally suited to provide constraints on seismic shaking‐triggered sediment slope failures and gravity flows, particularly since numerous published studies have linked paleo‐ to modern earthquakes to failures and flows within the DONET. The occurrences of the local 2016 M6.0 Mie‐ken and regional M7.0 Kumamoto earthquakes within and at regional distances, respectively, from the DONET data set provided an opportunity to explore this potential. We used DONET seismic recordings of the posited triggering shaking and to search for submarine slide signals and continuous temperature and pressure data to detect pulses of warm and densified water indicative of passing flows. We developed and applied a variety of analytical methods to eliminate signals generated by water column processes, while leaving slope failures and sediment gravity flow anomalies as residuals. Our explorations yielded no evidence that earthquake shaking initiated either phenomenon, which we suggest reflects the finicky nature both of the detection of and the physical processes that contribute to slope failures and flows (i.e., both require satisfying precise suites of conditions). Nonetheless, this negative result, our analyses, and the estimates of physical properties we derived for them, provide useful lessons and inputs for future studies.",

      "abstract": "\n Cross correlation of ambient seismic noise has begun to provide detailed images of the Earth that are not possible to attain using earthquake-based or active-source imaging techniques. However, the theoretical justification for the ambient noise correlation or seismic interferometry approach typically relies on an equipartition or diffuse field assumption that is not expected to be satisfied on Earth. Here we demonstrate that a Bayesian inference approach to calculating the expected cross correlation of seismic signals leads to an improved understanding of its relationship with the Green’s function. The Bayesian derivation is found to exactly replicate the equipartition result under a global energy constraint, and is able to accommodate any number of other constraints that typically cannot be utilized in other approaches. With these stronger constraints, the cross correlation is found to deviate more and more strongly from the ‘expected’ Green’s function, but nonetheless a specific prediction can be made regarding the expected cross correlation which can be used as a more reliable point of comparison with observations than the Green’s function. The approach therefore provides a path forward for how to use seismic cross correlation data under more and more realistic conditions and improvements in knowledge, and should eventually help improve the accuracy of resulting images of the Earth.",

The study investigates the theoretical basis for this technique, which often assumes conditions not fully met in reality. A Bayesian approach is introduced to calculate expected cross-correlations, relating them to Green's functions under various constraints. The findings suggest that with stronger constraints, cross-correlations diverge from Green's functions, but a specific prediction for the expected cross-correlation can be made, potentially improving the accuracy of Earth imaging.",

      "abstract": "Abstract. In the upper part of mountain river catchments, large\namounts of loose debris produced by mass-wasting processes can accumulate at the base of slopes and cliffs. Sudden destabilizations of these deposits are thought to trigger energetic sediment pulses that may travel in downstream rivers with little exchange with the local bed. The dynamics of these exogenous sediment pulses remain poorly known because direct field\nobservations are lacking, and the processes that control their formation and propagation have rarely been explored. Here we carry out flume experiments with the aims of investigating (i) the role of sediment accumulation zones in the generation of sediment pulses, (ii) their propagation dynamics in low-order mountain channels, and (iii) the capability of seismic methods to unravel their physical properties. We use an original setup wherein we supply liquid and solid discharge to a low-slope storage zone acting like a natural sediment accumulation zone that is connected to a downstream 18 % steep channel equipped with geophones. We show that the ability of the self-formed deposit to generate sediment pulses is controlled by the fine fraction of the mixture. In particular, when coarse grains coexist with a high content of finer particles, the storage area experiences alternating phases of aggradation and erosion strongly impacted by grain sorting. The upstream processes also influence the composition of the sediment pulses, which are formed by a front made of the coarsest fraction of the sediment mixture, a body composed of a high concentration of sand corresponding to the peak of solid discharge, and a diluted tail that exhibits a wide grain size distribution. Seismic measurements reveal that the front dominates the overall seismic noise, but we observe a complex dependency between seismic power and sediment pulse transport characteristics, which questions the applicability of existing seismic theories in such a context. These findings challenge the classical approach for which the sediment budget of mountain catchments is merely reduced to an available volume, since not only\nhydrological but also granular conditions should be considered to predict\nthe occurrence and propagation of such sediment pulses.\n",

      "abstract": "Advances in machine learning (ML) techniques and computational capacity have yielded state‐of‐the‐art methodologies for processing, sorting, and analyzing large seismic data sets. In this study, we consider an application of ML for automatically identifying dominant types of impulsive seismicity contained in observations from a 34‐station broadband seismic array deployed on the Ross Ice Shelf (RIS), Antarctica from 2014 to 2017. The RIS seismic data contain signals and noise generated by many glaciological processes that are useful for monitoring the integrity and dynamics of ice shelves. Deep clustering was employed to efficiently investigate these signals. Deep clustering automatically groups signals into hypothetical classes without the need for manual labeling, allowing for the comparison of their signal characteristics and spatial and temporal distribution with potential source mechanisms. The method uses spectrograms as input and encodes their salient features into a lower‐dimensional latent representation using an autoencoder, a type of deep neural network. For comparison, two clustering methods are applied to the latent data: a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) and deep embedded clustering (DEC). Eight classes of dominant seismic signals were identified and compared with environmental data such as temperature, wind speed, tides, and sea ice concentration. The greatest seismicity levels occurred at the RIS front during the 2016 El Niño summer, and near grounding zones near the front throughout the deployment. We demonstrate the spatial and temporal association of certain classes of seismicity with seasonal changes at the RIS front, and with tidally driven seismicity at Roosevelt Island.",

      "abstract": "A subglacial groundwater system beneath Taylor Glacier, Antarctica, discharges hypersaline, iron‐rich brine episodically at the glacier surface to create Blood Falls. However, the triggering mechanism for these brine release events is not yet understood. Identifying which fracture processes are observed seismically can help us better characterize the hydrological system at Taylor Glacier, and more generally, provide us with a broader understanding of englacial hydrologic activity in cold glaciers. We document wintertime brine discharge using time‐lapse photography. Subfreezing air temperatures during the brine discharge indicate that surface melt‐induced hydrofracture is an unlikely trigger for brine release. Further, we analyze local seismic data to test a hypothesis that fracturing generates elevated surface wave energy preceding and/or coinciding with brine release events. Our results show no discernible elevated Rayleigh wave activity prior to or during Blood Falls brine release. Instead, we find a pattern of seismic events dominated by a seasonal signal, with more Rayleigh events occurring in the summer than the winter from the Blood Falls source area. We calculate that the volumetric opening of cracks that would generate Rayleigh waves at our detection limits are of similar size to myriad cracks in glacier ice, lake ice, and frozen sediment in the terminus area. We therefore propose that any fracturing coincident with brine release activity likely consists of a series of smaller opening events that are masked by other seismicity in the local environment.",

      "abstract": "Seismic waves are commonly used to monitor unrest before, during, and after volcanic eruptions. The source of seismic tremor during a sustained explosive volcanic eruption is not well understood. Recent observations of the 2016 eruption of Pavlof Volcano, Alaska, revealed a change in the relationship (hysteresis) between ash plume height and seismic amplitude over time. Based on similarities in physical processes and observed seismic tremor in rivers, we explore two key sources of seismic energy in the volcanic conduit: (1) forces exerted by particle impacts and (2) dynamic pressure changes by the turbulent flow. We develop a physical model calculating the seismic power spectral density (PSD), where forces on the conduit wall are convolved with the Green's function for Rayleigh waves. Using reasonable eruption parameters, the model is able to reproduce the frequency spectrum from the Pavlof eruption, although the modeled amplitudes are generally lower. We test the relative importance of different eruption parameters, including grain size, velocity, and conduit dimensions. We find that turbulence generally dominates over particle impacts. However, to reach the PSD amplitude during the Pavlof eruption, large grain sizes are required, as they have the greatest relative influence on the modeled amplitude. The hysteresis between plume height and seismic amplitude can then potentially be explained by grain size changes. The PSD shape is mostly determined by the Rayleigh‐wave quality factor Q, and substantial variations in seismic amplitude can be modeled assuming a constant mass eruption rate.",

      "abstract": "Rockfall risk is usually characterized by a high frequency of occurrence, difficulty in prediction (given high velocity, lack of noticeable forerunners, abrupt collapse, and complex mechanism), and a relatively high potential vulnerability, especially against people and communication routes. Considering that larger rockfalls and rockslides are generally anticipated by an increased occurrence of events, in this study, a framework based on microseismic monitoring is introduced for a temporal and spatial rockfall early warning. This approach is realized through the detection, classification, and localization of all the rockfalls recorded during a 6-month-long microseismic monitoring performed in a limestone quarry in central Italy. Then, in order to provide a temporal warning, an observable quantity of accumulated energy, associated to the rockfall rolling and bouncing and function of the number and volume of events in a certain time window, has been defined. This concept is based on the material failure method developed by Fukuzono-Voight. As soon as the first predicted time of failure and relative warning time are declared, all the rockfalls occurred in a previous time window can be located in a topographic map to find the rockfall susceptible area and thus to complement the warning with spatial information. This methodology has been successfully validated in an ex post analysis performed in the aforementioned quarry, where a large rockfall was forecasted with a lead time of 3 min. This framework provides a novel way for rockfall spatiotemporal early warning, and it could be helpful for activating traffic lights and closing mountain roads or other transportation lines using the knowledge of the time and location of a failure. Since this approach is not based on the detection of the triggering events (like for early warnings based on rainfall thresholds), it can be used also for earthquake-induced failures.",

Conventional seismic methods generally require tens of geophones together with active seismic sources for monitoring applications. While this is not an issue for mainland environment, it is restrictive for sea ice and prevents long‐term monitoring. We introduce a method to estimate sea ice thickness and elastic properties from passive recordings of the ambient seismic field with a minimal number of geophones. In comparison with our previous work (Moreau et al, 2020), where about 50 sensors were used, the number of geophones is reduced by one order of magnitude, thanks to a new strategy of inversion of the passive seismic data. The method combines noise interferometry for estimating the elastic properties, with a Bayesian inversion of the dispersion in the waveforms of icequakes for inferring ice thickness, based on passive recordings from only 3 to 5 geophones, depending on the signal to noise ratio. We demonstrate its potential both on data recorded on thin landfast ice in Svalbard, and on data recorded on thick pack ice in the Arctic ocean.",

Our work represents the first comprehensive lab observations of unstable ice‐slip events and replicates several seismological field observations of glacier slip, such as slip velocity, stress drop, and the relationship between stress drop and recurrence interval. We also observe that stick‐slips initiate above a critical driving velocity and that stress drop magnitude decreases with further increases in velocity, consistent with friction theory and rock‐on‐rock friction laboratory experiments. Our results demonstrate that glacier slip behavior can be accurately predicted by the constitutive rate‐and‐state friction laws that were developed for rock friction.",

These methods enable direct monitoring of the bed in ways that complement other geophysical techniques, such as geodetic or ground penetrating radar observations. In this work, we report on the analysis of passive seismic data collected from the interior of the North East Greenland Ice Stream, the Greenland ice sheet's largest outlet glacier. We record thousands of basal earthquakes, many of which repeat with nearly identical waveforms. We also record many long-duration glacial tremor episodes that migrate across the seismic network with slow velocities (e.g. ~4–12 m s−1). Analysis of the basal earthquakes indicates a transition between times of individual event activity and times of tremor activity. We suggest that both processes are produced by shear slip at localized asperities along the bed. The transition between discrete and quasi-continuous slipping modes may be driven by pore-water pressure transients or heterogeneous strain accumulation in the ice due to strength contrasts of the underlying till.",

      "abstract": "Bed-load discharge of a river can be monitored by indirectly measuring the acoustic pulses generated when the bed load collides with a steel pipe installed on the riverbed (i.e., pipe hydrophone measurement). However, existing methods used for filtering pulses from acoustic signals reflect a combination of bed-load collision frequency bands, thereby limiting characterization capabilities. This study proposes an improved filtering method that separates and efficiently examines frequency bands that are highly correlated with bed-load collision characteristics. Herein, an experimental hydraulic model and bed-load collision sound-measurement system were constructed, and bed-load collision experiments were repeatedly performed for collecting acoustic data using a pipe hydrophone. Fast Fourier Transform analysis was performed on data to select the specific frequency bands and pressures reflecting the bed-load particle size. Furthermore, a bandpass method to examine bed-load collision sounds is also presented herein. Results indicate that in comparison with existing filtering methods, the proposed bandpass method yields higher detection rates under bed-load conditions of low flow rate and small particle size, thereby demonstrating its enhanced effectiveness.",

      "abstract": "Hydraulically forced crevassing is thought to reduce the stability of ice shelves and ice sheets, affecting structural integrity and providing pathways for surface meltwater to the bed. It can cause ice shelves to collapse and ice sheets to accelerate into the ocean. However, direct observations of the hydraulically forced crevassing process remain elusive. Here we report a novel method and observations that use icequakes to directly observe crevassing and determine the role of hydrofracture. Crevasse icequake depths from seismic observations are compared to a theoretically derived maximum dry crevasse depth. We observe icequakes below this depth, suggesting hydrofracture. Furthermore, icequake source mechanisms provide insight into the fracture process, with predominantly opening cracks observed, which have opening volumes of hundredths of a cubic meter. Our method and findings provide a framework for studying a critical process that is key for the stability of ice shelves and ice sheets and, therefore, future sea level rise projections.",

      "abstract": "Landslides, earthquakes and other natural disasters are expected to increase in the Arctic, yet our ability to make informed decisions about safety is tightly limited by lack of data. As part of the Integrated Arctic Observation System (INTAROS) project, geophones were installed by residents in Greenland and by University of Bergen in Svalbard in 2018. The purpose of the installations was to explore challenges and benefits of community-based data collection for seismological monitoring in the Arctic region. Raspberry Shake units with one/three-component velocity sensors were selected for the deployment, due to their user-friendly configuration, easy installation, and well established digital platform and web services. The purpose of engaging community members in the use of geophone sensors was to monitor earthquakes, cryoseisms (events generated by ice mass), and landslides. We report our findings with respect to challenges regarding the installation and operation of the Raspberry Shake sensors at both locations. Connecting community-based recordings with permanent seismological networks improved both the detection capability and the data support for understanding seismic events in Greenland. In contrast, finding suitable locations for deployments in Longyearbyen turned out to be challenging, because most buildings are constructed on poles due to the permafrost and indoor space is expensive. Promoting citizen seismology in the Arctic could improve monitoring of seismic events in the Arctic while simultaneously raising community awareness of natural hazards.",

      "abstract": "Using a fully nonlinear Bayesian approach based on forward modelling of granular flow, we invert for landslide parameters (volume, release geometry and rheology) from different kinds of observations. Synthetic tests show that the runout distance and the deposit area by themselves do not constrain landslide parameters. Better constraints on landslide parameters are obtained from the thickness distribution of the landslide deposits, as well as from the force history applied by the landslide to the ground, which contains information on the landslide dynamics. Therefore, inverting force histories calculated from seismic broad-band records is an important alternative to inverting thickness distributions of landslide deposits, which are usually difficult to obtain. We test the method on the 1997 Boxing Day debris avalanche on Montserrat Island, which involved 40 − 50 Mm3. The Bayesian inversion and granular flow model provide good estimates for volume, release geometry and effective friction coefficient. This study thus underlines the value of broad-band seismic records as observations to monitor landslides and validation for their numerical flow models..",

      "abstract": "Abstract Rapid shallow landslides are a significant hillslope erosion mechanism and limited understanding of their initiation and development results in persistent risk to infrastructure. Here, we analyse the slope above the strategic A83 Rest and be Thankful road in the west of Scotland. An inventory of 70 landslides (2003–2020) shows three types of shallow landslide, debris flows, creep deformation, and debris falls. Debris flows dominate and account for 5,350 m3 (98%) of shallow-landslide source volume across the site. We use novel time-lapse vector tracking to detect and quantify slope instabilities, whilst seismometers demonstrate the potential for live detection and location of debris flows. Using on-slope rainfall data, we show that shallow-landslides are typically triggered by abrupt changes in the rainfall trend, characterised by high-intensity, long duration rainstorms, sometimes part of larger seasonal rainfall changes. We derive empirical antecedent precipitation (>62 mm) and intensity-duration (>10 h) thresholds over which shallow-landslides occur. Analysis shows the new thresholds are more effective at raising hazard alerts than the current management plan. The low-cost sensors provide vital notification of increasing hazard, the initiation of movement, and final failure. This approach offers considerable advances to support operational decision-making for infrastructure threatened by complex slope hazards.",

The study suggests that rainfall data can be used to derive thresholds for shallow-landslide occurrence, potentially improving hazard alerts.",

      "abstract": "The changes in the seismic signals generated by avalanches recorded at three sites along a path at the Vallée de la Sionne (VdlS) experimental site are presented. We discuss and correlate the differences in the duration, signal amplitudes, and frequency content of the sections (Signal ONset (ON), Signal Body (SBO), and Signal TAil and Signal ENd STA-SEN) of the spectrograms with the evolution of the powder, transitional and wet snow avalanches along a path. The development of the avalanche front was quantified using the exponential function in time F (t) = K’ exp (β t) fitted to the shape of the signal ONset (SON section of the spectrogram. The speed of the avalanche front is contained in β. To this end, a new method was developed. The three seismic components were converted into one seismic component (FS), when expressing the vector in polar coordinates. We linked the theoretical function of the shape of the FS-SON section of the spectrogram to the numerical coefficients of its shape after considering the spectrogram as an image. This allowed us to obtain the coefficients K’ and β. For this purpose, the Hough Transform (HT) was applied to the image. The values of the resulting coefficients K’ and β are included in different ranges in accordance with the three types of avalanche. Curves created with these coefficients enable us to estimate the development of the different avalanche types along the path. Our results show the feasibility of classifying the type of avalanche through these coefficients. Average speeds of the avalanches approaching the recording sites were estimated. The speed values of wet and transitional avalanches are consistent with those derived from GEODAR (GEOphysical Doppler radAR) measurements, when available. The absence of agreement in the speed values obtained from seismic signals and GEODAR measurements for powder snow avalanches indicates, for this type of avalanche, a different source of the measured signal. Hence, the use of the two measuring systems proves to be complementary.",

      "abstract": "Bedload transport drives morphological changes in gravel‐bed streams and sediment transfer in catchments. The large impact forces associated with bedload motion and its highly dynamic spatiotemporal nature make it difficult to monitor bedload transport in the field. In this study, we revise a physically‐based model of bedload‐induced seismic ground motion proposed by Tsai et al. (2012) and apply it to invert bedload flux from seismic measurements alongside an Alpine stream. First, we constrain the seismic response of a braided river reach with a simple active experiment using a series of large‐rock impacts. This allows the characterization of surface wave propagation and attenuation with distance from the impact source. Second, we distinguish bedload‐generated ground vibrations from those caused by turbulent flow using frequency‐based scaling relationships between seismic power and discharge. Finally, absolute bedload transport rates are quantified from seismic measurements using inverse modeling based on a simplified formulation of bedload particle motion. The results are verified with a large data set of bedload samples (between 0.01 and 1 kg/m/s), demonstrating that seismic measurements can provide an indirect measure for bedload flux with an uncertainty of less than one order of magnitude. Larger deviations may be due to the contribution of turbulent flow effects and remaining uncertainties in particle impact mechanics (elasticity and velocity). When constraining these uncertainties, seismic monitoring may provide an accurate and continuous means to investigate bedload dynamics in gravel‐bed streams.",

The grounding zone of Whillans Ice Stream, West Antarctica, exhibits an abrupt transition in basal properties from the grounded ice to the ocean cavity over distances of less than 0.5–1 km. Active-source seismic methods reveal the downglacier-most grounded portion of the ice stream is underlain by a relatively stiff substrate (relatively high shear wave velocities of 1100±430 m s−1) compared to the deformable till found elsewhere beneath the ice stream. Changes in basal reflectivity in our study area cannot be explained by the stage of the tide. Several kilometres upstream of the grounding zone, layers of subglacial water are detected, as are regions that appear to be water layers but are less than the thickness resolvable by our technique. The presence of stiff subglacial sediment and thin water layers upstream of the grounding zone supports previous studies that have proposed the dewatering of sediment within the grounding zone and the trapping of subglacial water upstream of the ocean cavity. The setting enables calibration of our methodology using returns from the floating ice shelf. This allows a comparison of different techniques used to estimate the sizes of the seismic sources, a constraint essential for the accurate recovery of subglacial properties. We find a strong correlation (coefficient of determination=0.46) between our calibrated method and a commonly used multiple-bounce method, but our results also highlight the incomplete knowledge of other factors affecting the amplitude of seismic sources and reflections in the cryosphere.\n",

      "abstract": "We investigated temporal variations of seismic wave velocity associated with hydraulic fracturing using Green's functions computed from ambient noise data. In October and November of 2014, we set up a broadband array at a shale play site inside the Sichuan basin where a pilot horizontal drilling and hydraulic injections were conducted. We first computed cross‐correlation functions using continuous data recorded by 21 three‐component broadband sensors deployed around the treatment well. We then employed a running window correlation‐based coda wave interferometry technique to measure apparent velocity changes from the daily Green's functions of all the station pairs in the frequency range of 1 to 3 Hz. We found significant velocity changes right after the hydraulic fracturing, which exhibited a clear direction‐dependent pattern. S wave velocity along raypaths parallel to the well trajectory showed a clear increase while those perpendicular exhibited a small decrease. The anisotropic changes in seismic velocity observed here were also confirmed from surface wave horizontal particle motion data. By comparing our observations with normal stress changes calculated with a half‐space elastic model, we speculate that stress changes induced by the hydraulic fracturing were likely to be responsible for the observed anisotropic changes in seismic velocity. Our results suggest that time‐lapse seismic imaging with ambient noise data provides a promising probe for monitoring geomechanical changes related to exploitation of unconventional oil and gas resources.",

      "abstract": "Improving our understanding of glacial sliding is crucial for constraining basal drag in ice dynamics models. We use icequakes, sudden releases of seismic energy as the ice slides over the bed, to provide geophysical observations that can be used to aid understanding of the physics of glacial sliding and constrain ice dynamics models. These icequakes are located at the bed of an alpine glacier in Switzerland and the Rutford Ice Stream, West Antarctica, two extremes of glacial settings and spatial scales. We investigate a number of possible icequake source mechanisms by performing full waveform inversions to constrain the fundamental physics and stress release during an icequake stick‐slip event. Results show that double‐couple mechanisms best describe the source for the events from both glacial settings and the icequakes originate at or very near the ice‐bed interface. We also present an exploratory method for attempting to measure the till shear modulus, if indirect reflected icequake radiation is observed. The results of this study increase our understanding of how icequakes are associated with basal drag while also providing the foundation for a method of remotely measuring bed shear strength.",

We find flow-parallel streaks of basal icequakes beneath the WIP, which we conjecture are related to the presence of mega-scale glacial lineations (MSGLs) indicated by ice-penetrating radar, with at least one streak originating in a local trough adjacent to a MSGL. Patterned basal seismicity can be caused by systematic spatial variation in basal pore pressure, bed-material frictional properties, or both. We interpret these flow-parallel icequake streaks as being due to frictionally heterogeneous bed materials in the presence of a streamlined ice-stream bed: bedform ridges correspond to aseismic, high-porosity deforming till, and some troughs to ephemeral exposures of deeper, seismogenic material such as lodged till or older sediments or rocks. Our results are consistent with MSGL formation by either erosion in troughs to expose deeper seismogenic material, or deposition of aseismic high-porosity till in bedform highs. Our results also suggest that evolving subglacial geomorphology can impact basal traction by reorganizing the spatial distribution of basal materials with varying mechanical properties.",

      "abstract": "Lahar monitoring on active volcanoes is challenging, and the ever changing environment leads to inconsistent results that hamper a warning systems ability to characterize the flow event properly. Therefore, more data, new methods, and the use of different sensors needs to be tested, which could lead to improvements in warning capabilities. Here, we present data from a 3-component broadband seismometer and video camera installed 3 m from the Lumbre channel on Volcán de Colima, Mexico to understand rheology differences within multiple lahar events that occurred in late 2016. We examine differences in frequency and directionality from each seismic component. Results indicate an increase in peak frequency above background in each component when a lahar nears the sensor, and a decrease in overall peak frequency when transitioning from a streamflow to a higher concentration flow. The seismic frequency distribution for the cross-channel component for the streamflow has a wider range compared with the lahar events. In contrast, the peak spectral frequency of the streamflow is narrower in comparison to the lahar events in the flow parallel and vertical directions. Estimated directionality ratios (cross-channel signal divided by flow parallel signal) yielded further evidence for a rheologic change between streamflow and lahars. Directionality ratios >1 were calculated for each lahar, and <1 for streamflow. Finally, we demonstrate from component analyses that channelization or freedom of movement in the cross-channel, bedload transport in the flow parallel, and bed composition in the vertical directions are possibly the main drivers in the peak spectral frequency output of lahars. The results described here indicate that using all three components may provide important information about lahar dynamics, which may be useful for automatic detection and warning systems, and using all three components should be encouraged.",

      "abstract": "\n A rockfall (RF) is a ubiquitous geohazard that is difficult to monitor or predict and poses a significant risk for people and transportation in several hilly and mountainous environments. The seismic signal generated by RF carries abundant physical and mechanical information. Thus, signals can be used by researchers to reconstruct the event location, onset time, volume and trajectory, and develop an efficient early warning system. Therefore, the precise automatic detection and classification of RF events are important objectives for scientists, especially in seismic monitoring arrays. An algorithm called DESTRO (DEtection and STorage of ROckfalls) aimed at combining seismic event automatic detection and classification was implemented ad hoc within the MATLAB environment. In event detection, the STA/LTA (short-time-average through long-time-average) method combined with other parameters, such as the minimum duration of an RF and the minimum interval time between two continuous seismic events is used. Furthermore, nine significant features based on the frequency, amplitude, seismic waveform, duration and multiple station attributes are newly proposed to classify seismic events in a RF environment. In particular, a three-step classification method is proposed for the discrimination of five different source types: RFs, earthquakes (EQs), tremors, multispike events (MSs) and subordinate MS events. Each component (vertical, east–west and north–south) at each station within the monitoring network is analysed, and a three-step classification is performed. At a given time, the event series detected from each component are integrated and reclassified component by component and station by station into a final event-type series as an output result. By this algorithm, a case study of the seven-month-long seismic monitoring of a former quarry in Central Italy was investigated by means of four triaxial velocimeters with continuous acquisition at a sampling rate of 200 Hz. During this monitoring period, a human-induced RF simulation was performed, releasing 95 blocks (in which 90 blocks validated) of different sizes from the benches of the quarry. Consequently, 64.9 per cent of EQs within 100 km were confirmed in a one-month monitoring period, 88 blocks in the RF simulation were classified correctly as RF events and 2 blocks were classified as MSs given their small energy. Finally, an ad hoc section of the algorithm was designed specifically for RF classification combined with EQ recognition. The algorithm could be applied in slope seismic monitoring to monitor the dynamic states of rock masses, as well as in slope instability forecasting and risk evaluation in EQ-prone areas.",
      "summary": "This study addresses the problem of detecting and classifying rockfall events using microseismic monitoring networks.

      "abstract": "Geophysical granular flows exert basal forces that generate seismic signals, which can be used to better monitor and model these severe natural hazards. A number of empirical relations and existing models link these signals' high‐frequency components to a variety of flow properties, many of which are inaccessible by other analyses. However, the range of validity of the empirical relations remains unclear and the models lack validation, owing to the difficulty of adequately controlling and instrumenting field‐scale flows. Here, we present laboratory experiments investigating the normal forces exerted on a basal plate by dense and partially dense flows of spherical glass particles. We measured the power spectra of these forces and inferred predictions for these power spectra from the models for debris flows' seismic signals proposed by Kean et al. (2015, https://doi.org/10.1002/2015GL064811), Lai et al. (2018, https://doi.org/10.1029/2018GL077683), and Farin, Tsai, et al. (2019, https://doi.org/10.1002/esp.4677), using Hertz theory to extend Farin, Tsai, et al. (2019)'s models to higher frequencies. Comparison of our observations to these predictions, and to predictions derived from Bachelet (2018) and Bachelet et al. (2021)'s model for granular flows' seismic signals, shows those of Farin, Tsai, et al. (2019)'s “thin‐flow” model to be the most accurate, so we examine explanations for this accuracy and discuss its implications for geophysical flows' seismic signals. We also consider the normalization, by the mean force exerted by each flow, of the force's mean squared fluctuations, showing that this ratio varies by 4 orders of magnitude over our experiments, but is determined by the bulk inertial number of the flow.",

      "abstract": "\n At near-grounded glacier termini, calving can lead to the capsize of kilometre-scale (i.e. gigatons) unstable icebergs. The transient contact force applied by the capsizing iceberg on the glacier front generates seismic waves that propagate over teleseismic distances. The inversion of this seismic signal is of great interest to get insight into actual and past capsize dynamics. However, the iceberg size, which is of interest for geophysical and climatic studies, cannot be recovered from the seismic amplitude alone. This is because the capsize is a complex process involving interactions between the iceberg, the glacier and the surrounding water. This paper presents a first step towards the construction of a complete model, and is focused on the capsize in the open ocean without glacier front nor ice-mélange. The capsize dynamics of an iceberg in the open ocean is captured by computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations, which allows assessing the complexity of the fluid motion around a capsizing iceberg and how far the ocean is affected by iceberg rotation. Expressing the results in terms of appropriate dimensionless variables, we show that laboratory scale and field scale capsizes can be directly compared. The capsize dynamics is found to be highly sensitive to the iceberg aspect ratio and to the water and ice densities. However, dealing at the same time with the fluid dynamics and the contact between the iceberg and the deformable glacier front requires highly complex coupling that often goes beyond actual capabilities of fluid-structure interaction softwares. Therefore, we developed a semi-analytical simplified fluid-structure model (SAFIM) that can be implemented in solid mechanics computations dealing with contact dynamics of deformable solids. This model accounts for hydrodynamic forces through calibrated drag and added-mass effects, and is calibrated against the reference CFD simulations. We show that SAFIM significantly improves the accuracy of the iceberg motion compared with existing simplified models. Various types of drag forces are discussed. The one that provides the best results is an integrated pressure-drag proportional to the square of the normal local velocity at the iceberg’s surface, with the drag coefficient depending linearly on the iceberg’s aspect ratio. A new formulation based on simplified added-masses or computed added-mass proposed in the literature, is also discussed. We study in particular the change of hydrodynamic-induced forces and moments acting on the capsizing iceberg. The error of the simulated horizontal force ranges between 5 and 25 per cent for different aspect ratios. The added-masses affect the initiation period of the capsize, the duration of the whole capsize being better simulated when added-masses are accounted for. The drag force mainly affects the amplitude of the fluid forces and this amplitude is best predicted without added-masses.",

      "abstract": "The monitoring of bedload flux under flash flood conditions has been successfully achieved since 1992 using slot samplers in the semiarid Nahal Eshtemoa. In the present study, a surrogate bedload monitoring technique ‐ the Japanese plate microphone ‐ has been deployed and calibrated against data from the slot samplers. Since a slot sampler has a sensitivity threshold that becomes especially important when transport rates are low, different averaging periods should be considered for high and low fluxes. In order to overcome the deficiencies of time‐based aggregation used hitherto, we have developed a new method involving mass aggregation and commensurably variable intervals, thereby enabling a more accurate analysis and optimizing the bedload sampler's capabilities. The data derived with this new method has then been utilized to calibrate the Japanese plate microphone. The Eshtemoa is an ephemeral gravel bed channel with a high proportion of fine gravel (< 0.02 m); for these conditions, acoustic sensors have not been calibrated as yet. Two multiple linear regression models incorporating the effect of median bedload grain size on pulse rate have been established to predict bedload flux and cumulative transported bedload mass. The coefficients in these models are statistically significant. Good predictions are obtained for bedload flux (adj. r2 = 0.83) and for cumulative bedload mass (adj. r2 = 0.98) during flood recession. Overall, the multiple linear regression models, used in conjunction with the mass aggregation method of estimating bedload flux, suggest that field calibration of acoustic devices is feasible under these conditions for ca. 90% of the duration of bedload transport. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

      "abstract": "Two catastrophic landslides occurred in quick succession on 13 and 16 May 2019, from the north face of Joffre Peak, Cerise Creek, southern Coast Mountains, British Columbia. With headscarps at 2560 m and 2690 m elevation, both began as rock avalanches, rapidly transforming into debris flows along middle Cerise Creek, and finally into debris floods affecting the fan. Beyond the fan margin, a flood surge on Cayoosh Creek reached bankfull and attenuated rapidly downstream; only fine sediment reached Duffey Lake. The toe of the main debris flow deposit reached 4 km from the headscarp, with a travel angle of 0.28, while the debris flood phase reached the fan margin 5.9 km downstream, with a travel angle of 0.22. Photogrammetry indicates the source volume of each event is 2–3 Mm 3 , with combined volume of 5 Mm 3 . Lidar differencing, used to assess deposit volume, yielded a similar total result, although error in the depth estimate introduced large volume error masking the expected increase due to dilation and entrainment. The average velocity of the rock avalanche-debris flow phases, from seismic analysis, was ~ 25–30 m/s, and the velocity of the 16 May debris flood on the upper fan, from super-elevation and boulder sizes, was 5–10 m/s. The volume of debris deposited on the fan was ~ 10 4  m 3 , 2 orders of magnitude less than the avalanche/debris flow phases. Progressive glacier retreat and permafrost degradation were likely the conditioning factors; precursor rockfall activity was noted at least ~6 months previous; thus, the mountain was primed to fail. The 13 May landslide was apparently triggered by rapid snowmelt, with debuttressing triggering the 16 May event.",
      "summary": "This study examines two landslides that occurred on Joffre Peak in British Columbia during May 2019. The landslides began as rock avalanches and transformed into debris flows and floods as they moved downslope. Researchers used photogrammetry and lidar differencing to estimate the volume of the landslides and seismic analysis to estimate their velocity. The study suggests that glacier retreat and permafrost degradation likely contributed to the landslides, with rapid snowmelt potentially triggering the initial event.",

      "abstract": "Abstract. Ambient noise seismology has revolutionized seismic characterization of the Earth's crust from local to global scales. The estimate of Green's\nfunction (GF) between two receivers, representing the impulse response of elastic media, can be reconstructed via cross-correlation of the ambient\nnoise seismograms. A homogenized wave field illuminating the propagation medium in all directions is a prerequisite for obtaining an accurate GF. For\nseismic data recorded on glaciers, this condition imposes strong limitations on GF convergence because of minimal seismic scattering in homogeneous\nice and limitations in network coverage. We address this difficulty by investigating three patterns of seismic wave fields: a favorable distribution\nof icequakes and noise sources recorded on a dense array of 98 sensors on Glacier d'Argentiere (France), a dominant noise source constituted by\na moulin within a smaller seismic array on the Greenland Ice Sheet, and crevasse-generated scattering at Gornergletscher (Switzerland). In Glacier\nd'Argentiere, surface melt routing through englacial channels produces turbulent water flow, creating sustained ambient seismic sources and thus\nfavorable conditions for GF estimates. Analysis of the cross-correlation functions reveals non-equally distributed noise sources outside and within\nthe recording network. The dense sampling of sensors allows for spatial averaging and accurate GF estimates when stacked on lines of receivers. The\naveraged GFs contain high-frequency ( >30 Hz ) direct and refracted P waves in addition to the fundamental mode of dispersive Rayleigh waves above\n1  Hz . From seismic velocity measurements, we invert bed properties and depth profiles and map seismic anisotropy, which is likely\nintroduced by crevassing. In Greenland, we employ an advanced preprocessing scheme which includes match-field processing and eigenspectral\nequalization of the cross spectra to remove the moulin source signature and reduce the effect of inhomogeneous wave fields on the GFs. At\nGornergletscher, cross-correlations of icequake coda waves show evidence for homogenized incident directions of the scattered\nwave field. Optimization of coda correlation windows via a Bayesian inversion based on the GF cross coherency and symmetry further promotes the GF\nestimate convergence. This study presents new processing schemes on suitable array geometries for passive seismic imaging and monitoring of glaciers\nand ice sheets.",

      "abstract": "Bedload transport is recognized as a key process in the development of river channel forms; however, most rivers suffer from an absence of data. Performing bedload measurements to document bedload transport rates is a challenge, as the deployment of traditional bedload samplers is time consuming and risky in floods. Consequently, bedload measurements are rarely executed. Alternative techniques are being developed to complement the use of traditional bedload measurements and to provide continuous monitoring. Passive acoustic measurements are made with hydrophones, measuring the underwater sounds naturally generated by bedload impacts in rivers. This paper proposes an innovative deployment of hydrophones to record bedload sounds at the scale of a cross section. The measured acoustic signals are interpreted with bedload samplings and with hydraulic and river bed parameters. Field experiments were done in 14 different sites, exploring a diversity of rivers. Bedload flux was observed to be the most consistent variable explaining the monitored acoustic power. Based on 25 experiments on 14 rivers, the cross‐section‐averaged acoustic power was related to the specific bedload flux and showed a good agreement (60% of bedload flux estimated within a factor of 2). The robustness of the obtained calibration curve remains to be tested. However, the potential of passive acoustic profiles to provide a continuous measurement of bedload sounds that could be used in the development of bedload gauging stations is shown.",

It explores using passive acoustic measurements with hydrophones as an alternative to traditional methods. Acoustic signals were interpreted using bedload samples along with hydraulic and riverbed parameters from multiple field sites.

These events contain a high\nproportion of surface wave energy and produce high-quality dispersion images\nusing an apparent offset re-sorting and inter-trace delay minimisation\ntechnique to locate the seismic source, followed by cross-correlation\nbeamforming dispersion imaging. The dispersion images are highly analogous\nto surface wave studies of pavements and display a complex multimodal\ndispersion pattern. Supported by theoretical modelling based on a highly\nsimplified arrangement of horizontal layers, we infer that a ∼3.5–4.5 m thick, stiff, high-velocity layer overlies a ∼30 m\nthick layer that is significantly softer and slower at our study site. Based\non previous studies we link the upper layer with syngenetic ground ice\nformed in aeolian sediments, while the underlying layer is linked to\nepigenetic permafrost in marine-deltaic sediments containing unfrozen saline\npore water. Comparing events from spring and autumn indicates that temporal\nvariation can be resolved via passive seismic monitoring.

      "abstract": "Abstract. Water flowing below glaciers exerts a major control on glacier basal sliding. However, our knowledge of the physics of subglacial hydrology and its link with sliding is limited because of lacking observations. Here we use a 2-year-long dataset made of on-ice-measured seismic and in situ-measured glacier basal sliding speed on Glacier d'Argentière (French Alps) to investigate the physics of subglacial channels and its potential link with glacier basal sliding. Using dedicated theory and concomitant measurements of water discharge, we quantify temporal changes in channels' hydraulic radius and hydraulic pressure gradient. At seasonal timescales we find that hydraulic radius and hydraulic pressure gradient respectively exhibit a 2- and 6-fold increase from spring to summer, followed by comparable decrease towards autumn. At low discharge during the early and late melt season channels respond to changes in discharge mainly through changes in hydraulic radius, a regime that is consistent with predictions of channels' behaviour at equilibrium. In contrast, at high discharge and high short-term water-supply variability (summertime), channels undergo strong changes in hydraulic pressure gradient, a behaviour that is consistent with channels behaving out of equilibrium. This out-of-equilibrium regime is further supported by observations at the diurnal scale, which prove that channels pressurize in the morning and depressurize in the afternoon. During summer we also observe high and sustained basal sliding speed, which supports that the widespread inefficient drainage system (cavities) is likely pressurized concomitantly with the channel system. We propose that pressurized channels help sustain high pressure in cavities (and therefore high glacier sliding speed) through an efficient hydraulic connection between the two systems. The present findings provide an essential basis for testing the physics represented in subglacial hydrology and glacier sliding models.\n",

      "abstract": "Abstract. Surficial mass wasting events are a hazard worldwide. Seismic and acoustic signals from these often remote processes, combined with other geophysical observations, can provide key information for monitoring and rapid response efforts and enhance our understanding of event dynamics. Here, we present seismoacoustic data and analyses for two very large ice–rock avalanches occurring on Iliamna Volcano, Alaska (USA), on 22 May 2016 and 21 June 2019. Iliamna is a glacier-mantled stratovolcano located in the Cook Inlet, ∼200 km from Anchorage, Alaska. The volcano experiences massive, quasi-annual slope failures due to glacial instabilities and hydrothermal alteration of volcanic rocks near its summit. The May 2016 and June 2019 avalanches were particularly large and generated energetic seismic and infrasound signals which were recorded at numerous stations at ranges from ∼9 to over 600 km. Both avalanches initiated in the same location near the head of Iliamna's east-facing Red Glacier, and their ∼8 km long runout shapes are nearly identical. This repeatability – which is rare for large and rapid mass movements – provides an excellent opportunity for comparison and validation of seismoacoustic source characteristics. For both events, we invert long-period (15–80 s) seismic signals to obtain a force-time representation of the source. We model the avalanche as a sliding block which exerts a spatially static point force on the Earth. We use this force-time function to derive constraints on avalanche acceleration, velocity, and directionality, which are compatible with satellite imagery and observed terrain features. Our inversion results suggest that the avalanches reached speeds exceeding 70 m s−1, consistent with numerical modeling from previous Iliamna studies. We lack sufficient local infrasound data to test an acoustic source model for these processes. However, the acoustic data suggest that infrasound from these avalanches is produced after the mass movement regime transitions from cohesive block-type failure to granular and turbulent flow – little to no infrasound is generated by the initial failure. At Iliamna, synthesis of advanced numerical flow models and more detailed ground observations combined with increased geophysical station coverage could yield significant gains in our understanding of these events.\n",

Specifically, the research focuses on two large ice-rock avalanches that occurred on Alaska's Iliamna Volcano in 2016 and 2019. The authors inverted seismic signals to model the avalanches as sliding blocks and derive constraints on their dynamics. The derived avalanche speeds were consistent with previous numerical modeling, while acoustic data suggest infrasound production followed the initial failure.",

      "abstract": "Field data are needed for a better understanding of sea ice decline in the context of climate change. The rapid technological and methodological advances of the last decade have led to a reconsideration of seismic methods in this matter. In particular, passive seismology has filled an important gap by removing the need to use active sources. We present a seismic experiment where an array of 247 geophones was deployed on sea ice, in the Van Mijen fjord near Sveagruva (Svalbard). The array is a mix of 1C and 3C stations with sampling frequencies of 500 and 1000 Hz. They recorded continuously the ambient seismic field in sea ice between 28 February and 26 March 2019. Data also include active acquisitions on 1 and 26 March with a radar antenna, a shaker unit, impulsive sources, and artificial sources of seismic noise. This data set is of unprecedented quality regarding sea ice seismic monitoring, as it also includes thousands of microseismic events recorded each day. By combining passive seismology approaches with specific array processing methods, we demonstrate that the multimodal dispersion curves of sea ice can be calculated without an active source and then used to infer sea ice properties. We calculated an ice thickness, Young's modulus, and Poisson's ratio with values h = 54 ± 3 cm, E = 3.9 ± 0.15 GPa, and ν = 0.34 ± 0.02 on 1 March, and h = 58 ± 3 cm, E = 4.4 ± 0.15 GPa, and ν = 0.32 ± 0.02 on 5 March. These values are consistent with in situ field measurements and observations.",
      "summary": "This study retrieves sea ice thickness and elastic properties from the analysis of multimodal guided wave propagation recorded by seismic sensors deployed on Arctic sea ice. The authors demonstrate that the dispersion characteristics of flexural and other wave modes provide constraints on ice thickness, density, and elastic moduli. The methodology offers a non-destructive, passive seismological approach for characterizing sea ice properties, relevant to monitoring cryosphere changes in the context of climate change.",

      "abstract": "High‐latitude rivers are commonly covered by ice for up to one third of the year. Our understanding of the effects of ice on channel morphodynamics and bedload transport is hindered by the difficulties of sensing through the ice and dangers of field work on thin ice or during ice break‐up. To avoid this drawback, we used seismic signals to interpret processes and quantify water and sediment fluxes. Our objective was to determine seasonal differences in hydraulics and bedload sediment transport under ice‐covered versus open‐channel flow conditions using a small seismic network and to provide a first‐order estimation of sediment flux in a Fennoscandian river. Our study reach was on a straight, low‐gradient section of the Sävar River in northern Sweden. Interpretations of seismic signals, from a station 40 m away from the river, and inverted physical models of river stage and bedload flux indicate clear seasonal differences between ice‐covered and open‐channel flow conditions. Diurnal cycles in seismic signals reflecting turbulence and sediment transport are evident directly after ice break‐up. Analysis of seismic signals of ice‐cracking support our visual interpretation of ice break‐up timing and the main ice break‐up mechanism as thermal rather than mechanical. Assuming the bulk of sediment moves during ice break‐up and the snowmelt flood, we calculate a minimum annual sediment flux of 56.2 ± 0.7 t/km2, which drastically reduces the uncertainty from previous estimates (0–50 t/km2) that exclude ice‐covered or ice break‐up periods.",

      "abstract": "We use cross correlation of the ambient seismic field to estimate seasonal variations of seismic velocity in the Mississippi Embayment and to determine the underlying physical mechanisms. Our main observation is that the δt/t variations correlate primarily with the water table fluctuation, with the largest positive value from May to July and the largest negative value in September/October relative to the annual mean. The δv/v residuals after water level fluctuation correction correlate with air pressure in the short term and follow the trend of temperature in the long term. The δv/v residuals after water level fluctuation and air pressure correction correlate inversely with the wind speed. The correlation coefficients between water table fluctuation and δt/t are independent of the interstation distance and frequency, but high coefficients are observed more often between 0.3 and 1 Hz than between 1 and 2 Hz because high‐frequency coherent signals attenuate faster than low‐frequency ones. The δt/t variations lag behind the water table fluctuation by about 20 days, which suggests that the velocity changes can be attributed to the pore pressure diffusion effect. The seasonal variations of δt/t are azimuthally independent, and a large increase of noise amplitude only introduces a small increase to the δt/t variation. At close distances, the maximum δt/t holds a wide range of values, which is likely related to local structure. At larger distances, velocity variations sample a larger region so that it stabilizes to a more uniform value. We find that the observed changes in wave speed can be explained by a poroelastic model.",

The initiation and propagation processes of a rapidly-rising jokulhlaup are still not fully understood. Seismic monitoring can contribute to an improved process understanding, but comprehensive long-term seismic monitoring campaigns capturing the dynamics of a rapidly-rising jokulhlaup have not been reported so far. To fill this gap, we installed a seismic network at the marginal, ice-dammed lake of the A.P. Olsen Ice Cap (APO) in NE-Greenland. Episodic outbursts from the lake cause flood waves in the Zackenberg river, characterized by a rapid discharge increase within a few hours. Our 6 months long seismic dataset comprises the whole fill-and-drain cycle of the ice-dammed lake in 2012 and includes one of the most destructive floods recorded so far for the Zackenberg river. Seismic event detection and localization reveals abundant surface crevassing and correlates with changes of the river discharge. Seismic interferometry suggests the existence of a thin basal sedimentary layer. We show that the ballistic part of the first surface waves can potentially be used to infer medium changes in both the ice body and the basal layer. Interpretation of time-lapse interferograms is challenged by a varying ambient noise source distribution.",

      "abstract": "Glacier runoff and melt from volcanic and geothermal activity accumulates in glacier dammed lakes in glaciated areas around the world. These lakes eventually drain, creating hazardous subglacial floods that are usually only confirmed after they exit the glacier and reach local river systems, which can be many tens of kilometres from the flood source. Once in the river systems, they travel rapidly to populated areas. Such delayed detection represents a potentially lethal shortcoming in early-warning. Here we demonstrate how to advance early-warning potential through the analysis of four such floods in a glaciated region of Iceland. By comparing exceptional multidisciplinary hydrological, GPS and seismic ground vibration (tremor) data, we show that array analysis of seismic tremor can be used for early location and tracking of the subglacial flood front. Furthermore the timing and size of the impending flood can be estimated, prior to it entering the river system. Advanced warnings of between 20 to 34 hours are achieved for large (peak discharge of more than 3000 m3/s, accumulation time of ~ 5.25 years) to small floods (peak discharges from 210 to 380 m3/s, accumulation times of ~ 1.3 years) respectively. Subglacial lakes and jökulhlaups (glacier outburst floods) are common in volcanic and glaciated environments, and can pose potential threats to communities living downstream. Here, the authors find that seismic tremor signals during subglacial floods can be used to locate and track the speed and size of the flood before it arrives at the river system, and improves previous methods of early glacial flood warning by a factor of 5.",

      "abstract": "\n A network of seismometers has been installed on the Gugla rock glacier since October 2015 to estimate seismic velocity changes and detect microseismicity. These two processes are related to mechanical and structural variations occurring within the rock glacier. Seismic monitoring thus allows a better understanding of the dynamics of rock glaciers throughout the year. We observed seasonal variations in seismic wave velocity and microseismic activity over the 3 yr of the study. In the first part of our analysis, we used ambient noise correlations to compute daily changes of surface wave velocity. In winter, seismic wave velocities were higher, probably due to refreezing of the permafrost active layer and cooling of the uppermost permafrost layers, leading to increased overall rigidity of the medium. This assumption was verified using a seismic model of wave propagation that estimates the depth of P- and S-wave velocity changes from 0 down to 10 m. During melting periods, both a sudden velocity decrease and a decorrelation of the seismic responses were observed. These effects can probably be explained by the increased water content of the active layer. In the second part of our study, we focused on detecting microseismic signals generated in and around the rock glacier. This seismic activity (microquakes and rockfalls) also exhibits seasonal variations, with a maximum in spring and summer, which correlates principally with an exacerbated post-winter erosional phase of the front and a faster rock glacier displacement rate. In addition, we observed short bursts of microseismicity, both during snowfall and during rapid melting periods, probably due to pore pressure increase.",
      "summary": "This study presents seismic monitoring results from the Gugla rock glacier in Switzerland, using ambient noise correlation and microseismicity analysis. A seismometer network installed since 2015 reveals seismic velocity changes related to mechanical property variations driven by freeze-thaw cycles. The authors also detect and locate microseismic events associated with fracturing within the rock glacier. The combined approach demonstrates the potential of passive seismic monitoring for tracking the mechanical state and activity of rock glaciers in permafrost environments.",

Glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs) are a substantial hazard for downstream communities in vulnerable regions, yet unpredictable triggers and remote source locations make GLOF dynamics difficult to measure and quantify. Here, we revisit a destructive GLOF that occurred in Bhutan in 1994 and apply cross-correlation–based seismic analyses to track the evolution of the GLOF remotely (~100 kilometers from the source region). We use the seismic observations along with eyewitness reports and a downstream gauge station to constrain a numerical flood model and then assess geomorphic change and current state of the unstable lakes via satellite imagery. Coherent seismic energy is evident from 1 to 5 hertz beginning approximately 5 hours before the flood impacted Punakha village, which originated at the source lake and advanced down the valley during the GLOF duration. Our analysis highlights potential benefits of using real-time seismic monitoring to improve early warning systems.",

      "abstract": "The 2018 lower East Rift Zone eruption of Kīlauea (Hawai‘i) marked a dramatic change in the volcano’s 35-year-long rift zone eruption. The collapse of the middle East Rift Zone vent Pu‘u ‘Ō‘ō was followed by one of the volcano’s most voluminous eruptions in 500 years. Over the course of this 3-month eruption, the draining of summit-stored magma led to near-daily collapses of a portion of the caldera and ultimately up to 500 m of summit subsidence. While deformation data indicated that the summit and middle East Rift Zone were inflating for the previous several years, why Pu‘u ‘Ō‘ō collapsed and what initiated down-rift dike propagation remains unclear. Using ambient noise seismic interferometry, we show that a M l 5.3 decollement earthquake beneath Kīlauea’s south flank in June 2017 induced a coseismic decrease of up to 0.30% in seismic velocity throughout the volcano. This velocity decrease may have been caused by dynamic stress–induced shallow crustal fracture, i.e., weakening to dilatant crack growth, and was greatest near Pu‘u ‘Ō‘ō. Additionally, we verify a pre-eruptive increase in seismic velocity, consistent with increasing pressurization in the volcano’s shallow summit magma reservoir. This velocity increase occurred coincident with the first in a series of lower-crustal earthquake swarms, 6 days before a 2-month period of rapid summit and middle East Rift Zone inflation. The increase in up-rift magma-static pressure, combined with the pre-existing weakness from the June 2017 earthquake, may have facilitated down-rift dike propagation and the devastating 2018 eruption.",

      "abstract": "Seismic waves generated by rockfalls contain valuable information on the properties of these events. However, as rockfalls mainly occur in mountainous regions, the generated seismic waves can be affected by strong surface topography variations. We present a methodology for investigating the influence of topography using a Spectral‐Element‐based simulation of 3‐D wave propagation in various geological media. This methodology is applied here to Dolomieu crater on the Piton de la Fournaise volcano, Reunion Island, but it can be used for other sites, taking into account local topography and medium properties. The complexity of wave fields generated by single‐point forces is analyzed for different velocity models and topographies. Ground‐motion amplification is studied relative to flat reference models, showing that Peak Ground Velocity (PGV) and total kinetic energy can be amplified by factors of up to 10 and 20, respectively. Simulations with Dolomieu‐like crater shapes suggest that curvature variations are more influential than depth variations. Topographic effects on seismic signals from rockfalls at Dolomieu crater are revealed by interstation spectral ratios. Results suggest that propagation along the topography rather than source direction dominates the spectral ratios and that resulting radiation patterns can be neglected. The seismic signature of single rockfall impacts is studied. Using Hertz contact theory, impact force and duration are estimated and then used to scale simulations, achieving order‐of‐magnitude agreement with observed signal amplitudes and frequency thresholds. Our study shows that combining Hertz theory with high‐frequency seismic wave simulations on real topography improves the quantitative analysis of rockfall seismic signals.",

      "abstract": "Crustal pore pressure, which controls the activities of earthquakes and volcanoes, varies in response to rainfall. The status of pore pressure can be inferred from observed changes in seismic velocity. In this study, we investigate the response of crustal pore pressure to rainfall in southwestern Japan based on time series of seismic velocity derived from ambient noise seismic interferometry. To consider the heterogeneity of the area, rainfall and seismic velocity obtained at each location were directly compared. We used a band-pass filter to distinguish the rainfall variability from sea level and atmospheric pressure, and then calculated the cross-correlation between rainfall and variations in S-wave velocity (Vs). A mostly negative correlation between rainfall and Vs changes indicates groundwater recharge by rainfall, which increases pore pressure. The correlations differ between locations, where most of the observation stations with clear negative cross-correlations were located in areas of granite. On the other hand, we could not observe clear correlations in steep mountain areas, possibly because water flows through river without percolation. This finding suggests that geographical features contribute to the imprint of rainfall on deep formation pore pressure. We further modelled pore pressure change due to rainfall based on diffusion mechanism. A strong negative correlation between pore pressure estimated from rainfall and Vs indicates that the Vs variations are triggered by pore pressure diffusion in the deep formation. Our modelling results show a spatial variation of diffusion parameter which controls the pore pressure in deep formation. By linking the variations in seismic velocity and crustal pore pressure spatially, this study shows that seismic monitoring may be useful in evaluating earthquake triggering processes or volcanic activity.",

This view is challenged by recent seismic observations of stick‐slip motion at the ice‐bed interface. We revisit a high‐frequency (20–35 Hz) harmonic tremor recorded on Gornergletscher, Switzerland. In contrast to previous interpretation in terms of glaciohydraulic tremor, we present evidence for superimposed stick‐slip episodes as tremor sources: we locate the tremor source with matched field processing polarity optimization, which allows for azimuthal polarity patterns associated with nonisotropic moment tensors and yields a tremor source clustering near the glacier bed. Our analysis confirms an S wave radiation pattern in agreement with a double‐couple source derived from ice sliding over bedrock and explains our tremor observations in terms of glacier stick‐slip motion. Adding to observations of stick‐slip tremor beneath polar ice streams, this first report on stick‐slip tremor beneath Alpine ice favors widespread seismogenic glacier sliding.",

      "abstract": "Seismic noise recorded at the surface of Mars has been monitored since February 2019, using the InSight seismometers. This noise can reach −200 dB. It is 500 times lower than on Earth at night and it increases of 30 dB during the day. We analyze its polarization as a function of time and frequency in the band 0.03–1 Hz. We use the degree of polarization to extract signals with stable polarization independent of their amplitude and type of polarization. We detect polarized signals at all frequencies and all times. Glitches correspond to linear polarized signals which are more abundant during the night. For signals with elliptical polarization, the ellipse is in the horizontal plane below 0.3 Hz. In the 0.3‐1Hz high frequency band (HF) and except in the evening, the ellipse is in the vertical plane and the major axis is tilted. While polarization azimuths are different in the two frequency bands, they both vary as a function of local hour and season. They are also correlated with wind direction, particularly during the daytime. We investigate possible aseismic and seismic origins of the polarized signals. Lander or tether noise can be discarded. Pressure fluctuations transported by wind may explain part of the HF polarization but not the tilt of the ellipse. This tilt can be obtained if the source is an acoustic emission coming from high altitude at critical angle. Finally, in the evening when the wind is low, the measured polarized signals may correspond to the seismic wavefield of the Mars background noise.",

They find polarized signals at all frequencies, with variations related to time of day and season.

      "abstract": "Abstract Glacial environments exhibit temporally variable microseismicity. To investigate how microseismicity influences event detection, we implement two noise-adaptive digital power detectors to process seismic data from Taylor Glacier, Antarctica. We add scaled icequake waveforms to the original data stream, run detectors on the hybrid data stream to estimate reliable detection magnitudes and compare analytical magnitudes predicted from an ice crack source model. We find that detection capability is influenced by environmental microseismicity for seismic events with source size comparable to thermal penetration depths. When event counts and minimum detectable event sizes change in the same direction (i.e. increase in event counts and minimum detectable event size), we interpret measured seismicity changes as ‘true’ seismicity changes rather than as changes in detection. Generally, one detector (two degree of freedom (2dof)) outperforms the other: it identifies more events, a more prominent summertime diurnal signal and maintains a higher detection capability. We conclude that real physical processes are responsible for the summertime diurnal inter-detector difference. One detector (3dof) identifies this process as environmental microseismicity; the other detector (2dof) identifies it as elevated waveform activity. Our analysis provides an example for minimizing detection biases and estimating source sizes when interpreting temporal seismicity patterns to better infer glacial seismogenic processes.",

      "abstract": "Seismic interferometry is a powerful tool to monitor the seismic velocity change associated with volcanic eruptions. For the monitoring, changes in seismic velocity with environmental origins (such as precipitation) are problematic. In order to model the environmental effects, we propose a new technique based on a state‐space model. An extended Kalman filter estimates seismic velocity changes as state variables, with a first‐order approximation of the stretching method. We apply this technique to three‐component seismic records in order to detect the seismic velocity change associated with the Shinmoe‐dake eruptions in 2011 and 2018. First, ambient noise cross correlations were calculated from May 2010 to April 2018. We also modeled seismic velocity changes resulting from precipitation and the 2016 Kumamoto earthquake, with exponential type responses. Most of the results show no significant changes associated with the eruptions, although gradual inflation of the magma reservoir preceded the 2011 eruption by 1 year. The observed low sensitivity to static stress changes suggests that the fraction of geofluid and crack density at about 1‐km depth is small, and the crack shapes could be circular. Only one station pair west of the crater shows the significant drop associated with the eruption in 2011. The gradual drop of seismic velocity up to 0.05% preceded the eruption by 1 month. When the gradual drop began, volcanic tremors were activated at about 2‐km depth. These observations suggest that the drop could be caused by damage accumulation due to vertical magma migration beneath the summit.",

      "abstract": "Passive acoustic monitoring has revolutionized the characterization of industrial processes and the acoustic wavefield in various environments. However, cryospheric acoustic phenomena remain largely unknown, especially at medium and small scales. Furthermore, the englacial drainage system is poorly documented, even though it is fundamental for understanding water routing through the glacier body. Here I present the first‐of‐its‐kind in situ records of periodic or sustained acoustic signals generated by water drainage through crevasses at the calving front of a glacier, in this case a Greenlandic tidewater glacier. The generative mechanisms of gurgling and bubbling noise are explained as flow‐induced sounds that are excited by intermittent air‐water two‐phase flow and Helmholtz resonance, respectively. This paper demonstrates that there is the tremendous potential to study near‐surface glacier systems using acoustic methods and detect different flow patterns in englacial conduits from their acoustic signatures, both of which can significantly advance our understanding of glaciological processes.",

We identified microseismic signals using the short-term/long-term average trigger algorithm at four stations and classified them as long and short-duration events based on waveform, frequency, duration and magnitude characteristics. Both categories show systematical diurnal trends. The long-duration events are low-frequency tremor-like events that mainly occurred during the daytime with only several events per day. These events lasted tens of seconds to tens of minutes and are likely related to resonance of daytime meltwater. The dominant short-duration events mostly occurred during the night time with a peak occurrence frequency of ~360 h−1. Their short-duration (<0.2 s), high frequency (20–100 Hz) and dominance of Rayleigh waves are typical of events for near-surface crack opening. A strong negative correlation between the hourly event number and temperature change rate suggests that the occurrence of night-time events is controlled by the rate of night-time cooling. We estimated the near-surface tensile stress due to thermal contraction at night to be tens of kilopascals, which is enough to induce opening of surface cracks with pre-existing local stress concentrations, although we cannot exclude the effect of refreezing of meltwater produced during the day.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Passive seismology is becoming increasingly popular for glacier/ice-sheet structure investigations in Polar regions. Single-station passive seismic methods including P-wave receiver functions (PRFs), horizontal-to-vertical spectral ratio (HVSR) and a recently proposed autocorrelation method have been used to retrieve glacier/ice-sheet structures. Despite their successful applications, analysis regarding their detection abilities in different glaciological environments has not been reported. In this study, we compare ice thicknesses and vp/vs ratios obtained from the three methods using data collected at GAMSEIS and POLENET/ANET seismic arrays in Antarctica. Ice thickness estimates derived from the three methods are found to be consistent. Comparisons conducted under various model setups, including those involving tiled layers and sedimentary layers, show that the effectiveness of the autocorrelation method is not superior to the PRF method for retrieving ice-sheet structures. The autocorrelation method however can complement other methods as it only requires a single component seismic record.",

      "abstract": "Seismic attributes can be important predictors, either qualitative or quantitative, of reservoir geometries when they are correctly used in reservoir characterization studies. This paper discusses seismic attribute analyses and their usefulness in seismic geomorphology study of Moragot field of Pattani Basin, Gulf of Thailand. Early to Middle Miocene fluvial channel and overbank sands are the reservoirs in Pattani Basin. Due to their limited horizontal and vertical distribution, it is not always possible to predict the geometry and distribution of these sands based on the conventional seismic interpretation. This study utilized various seismic attributes, e.g., RMS amplitude analysis, spectral decomposition, semblance and dip-steered similarity, RGB blending to image the geometry and the spatial distribution of sand bodies in horizon and stratal slices at different stratigraphic intervals. Attribute analyses reveal, at shallow stratigraphic levels, RMS and semblance can successfully identify channel-shaped sand bodies and mud-filled channels associated with channel belts. On the other hand in deeper stratigraphic intervals, sand distribution can be imaged more effectively by using spectral decomposition and dip-steered similarity volumes. High-frequency spectral decomposition slices can image thin sands, and low-frequency slices can image thick sands quite effectively in deeper intervals. RGB blending of different frequency slices is particularly useful in delineating channel systems of various dimensions at deeper intervals. These images show the distribution of sands and mud-filled channels at various stratigraphic levels. The width of channel belts varies from 200 m to 3 km. These channel belts are N–S or NW–SE oriented. From the channel pattern and their dimensions, depositional environments can be predicted. Mud-filled channels identified in the horizon slices will act as a connectivity barrier between sand bodies at either side of the channel. They can also act as lateral and up-dip seal to form stratigraphic traps. The seismic attribute analyses clearly show the geometry and spatial distribution of sand bodies. Hence, this method for predicting sand body geometry might help in field development planning as well as in reducing exploration risk.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Icequakes at or near the bed of a glacier have the potential to allow us to investigate the interaction of ice with the underlying till or bedrock. Understanding this interaction is important for studying basal sliding of glaciers and ice streams, a critical process in ice dynamics models used to constrain future sea-level rise projections. However, seismic observations on glaciers can be dominated by seismic energy from surface crevassing. We present a method of automatically detecting basal icequakes and discriminating them from surface crevassing, comparing this method to a commonly used spectrum-based method of detecting icequakes. We use data from Skeidararjökull, an outlet glacier of the Vatnajökull Ice Cap, South-East Iceland, to demonstrate that our method outperforms the commonly used spectrum-based method. Our method detects a higher number of basal icequakes, has a lower rate of incorrectly identifying crevassing as basal icequakes and detects an additional, spatially independent basal icequake cluster. We also show independently that the icequakes do not originate from near the glacier surface. We conclude that the method described here is more effective than currently implemented methods for detecting and discriminating basal icequakes from surface crevassing.",

      "abstract": "Abstract. We used continuous data from a seismic monitoring system to automatically determine the avalanche activity at a remote field site above Davos, Switzerland.\nThe approach is based on combining a machine learning algorithm with array processing techniques to provide an operational method capable of near real-time classification.\nFirst, we used a recently developed method based on hidden Markov models (HMMs) to automatically identify events in continuous seismic data using only a single training event. For the 2016–2017 winter period, this resulted in 117 events. Second, to eliminate falsely classified events such as airplanes and local earthquakes, we implemented an additional HMM-based classifier at a second array 14 km away. By cross-checking the results of both arrays, we reduced the number of classifications by about 50 %. In a third and final step we used multiple signal classification (MUSIC), an array processing technique, to determine the direction of the source. As snow avalanches recorded at our arrays typically generate signals with small changes in source direction, events with large changes were dismissed. From the 117 initially detected events during the 4-month period, our classification workflow removed 96 events. The majority of the remaining 21 events were on 9 and 10 March 2017, in line with visual avalanche observations in the Davos region. Our results suggest that the classification workflow presented could be used to identify major avalanche periods and highlight the importance of array processing techniques for the automatic classification of avalanches in seismic data.\n",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Glacial seismicity provides important insights into glacier dynamic processes. We study the temporal distribution of cryogenic seismic signals (icequakes) at Holtedahlfonna, Svalbard, between April and August 2016 using a single three-component sensor. We investigate sources of observed icequakes using polarization analysis and waveform modeling. Processes responsible for five icequake categories are suggested, incorporating observations of previous studies into our interpretation. We infer that the most dominant icequake type is generated by surface crevasse opening through hydrofracturing. Secondly, bursts of high-frequency signals are presumably caused by repeated near-surface crevassing due to high strain rates during glacier fast-flow episodes. Furthermore, signals related to resonance in water-filled cracks, fracturing or settling events in dry firn or snow before the melt season, and processes at the glacier bed are observed. Amplitude of seismic background noise is clearly related to glacier runoff. We process ambient seismic noise to invert horizontal-to-vertical spectral ratios for a sub-surface seismic velocity model used to model icequake signals. Our study shows that a single seismic sensor provides useful information about seasonal ice dynamics in case deployment of a network is not feasible.",

      "abstract": "As new techniques exploiting the Earth's ambient seismic noise field are developed and applied, such as for the observation of temporal changes in seismic velocity structure, it is crucial to quantify the precision with which wave‐type measurements can be made. This work uses array data at the Homestake mine in Lead, South Dakota, and an array at Sweetwater, Texas, to consider two aspects that control this precision: the types of seismic wave contributing to the ambient noise field at microseism frequencies and the effect of array geometry. Both are quantified using measurements of wavefield coherence between stations in combination with Wiener filters. We find a strong seasonal change between body‐wave and surface‐wave content. Regarding the inclusion of underground stations, we quantify the lower limit to which the ambient noise field can be characterized and reproduced; the applications of the Wiener filters are about 4 times more successful in reproducing ambient noise waveforms when underground stations are included in the array, resulting in predictions of seismic time series with less than a 1% residual, and are ultimately limited by the geometry and aperture of the array, as well as by temporal variations in the seismic field. We discuss the implications of these results for the geophysics community performing ambient seismic noise studies, as well as for the cancellation of seismic Newtonian gravity noise in ground‐based, sub‐Hertz, gravitational‐wave detectors.",

      "abstract": "Many large calving events at Greenland's marine‐terminating glaciers generate globally detectable glacial earthquakes. We perform a cross‐correlation analysis using regional seismic data to identify events below the teleseismic detection threshold, focusing on the 24 hr surrounding known glacial earthquakes at Greenland's three largest glaciers. We detect additional seismic events in the minutes prior to more than half of the glacial earthquakes we study and following one third of them. Waveform modeling shows source mechanisms like those of previously known glacial earthquakes, a result consistent with available imagery. The seismic events thus do not represent a failure of the high subaerial ice cliff like that expected to trigger large‐scale calving and a marine ice‐cliff instability but, rather, rotational, buoyancy‐driven calving events, likely of the full glacier thickness. A limited investigation of the prevalence of smaller seismic events at times outside glacial‐earthquake windows identifies several additional events. However, we find that calving at the three glaciers we study—Jakobshavn Isbræ, Helheim Glacier, and Kangerdlugssuaq Glacier—often occurs as sequences of discrete buoyancy‐driven events in which multiple icebergs ranging in size over as much as three orders of magnitude are all lost within ∼30 min. We demonstrate a correlation between glacial‐earthquake magnitude and iceberg size for events with well‐constrained iceberg‐area estimates. Our results suggest that at least 10–30% more dynamic mass loss occurs through buoyancy‐driven calving at Greenland's glaciers than previously appreciated.",

Researchers used cross-correlation analysis of regional seismic data to identify events surrounding known glacial earthquakes. They detected additional seismic events before and after many of the studied earthquakes.

These findings indicate that dynamic mass loss through buoyancy-driven calving may be underestimated.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Englacial hydrology plays an important role in routing surface water to the glacier's bed and it consequently affects the glacier's dynamics. However, it is often difficult to observe englacial conduit conditions on temperate glaciers because of their short-lived nature. We acquired repeated active surface seismic data over the Rhone Glacier, Switzerland to monitor and characterise englacial conduit conditions. Amplitude-versus-angle analysis suggested that the englacial conduit is water filled and between 0.5 and 4 m thick. A grid of GPR profiles, acquired during the 2018 melt season, showed the englacial conduit network persisting and covering ~ 14,000 m2. In late summer 2018, several boreholes were drilled into the conduit network. We observed generally stable water pressure, but there were also short sudden increases. A borehole camera provided images of a fast flowing englacial stream transporting sediment through the conduit. From these observations, we infer that the englacial conduit network is fed by surface meltwater and morainal streams. The surface and morainal streams merge together, enter the glacier subglacially and flow through subglacial channels along the flank. These subglacial channels flow into highly efficient englacial conduits traversing the up-glacier section of the overdeepening before connecting with the subglacial drainage system.",

The ZHQ seismic station is located approximately 170 m west of the outlet of the Sanyanyu gully, and its power system was destroyed by the Sanyanyu debris flow when its leading edge reached the vicinity of the seismic station. In this paper, seismic signals recorded approximately 10 min before its termination are collected and analyzed to study the Sanyanyu debris flow. A double-exponential model is first proposed to quantitatively characterize seismic energy distributions in the frequency domain, which reveals that the peak frequency of seismic signals is around 5 Hz. Influenced by the Doppler effect, the peak frequency of the N–S component is the highest, and the U–D component is the lowest. Time–frequency analysis is applied to the seismic signals. From the spectrogram, it is easily observed that the formation time of the Sanyanyu debris flow is around 23:33:10. The entire debris flow is divided into three phases with distinct frequency characteristics, using 23:36:20 and 23:37:35 as crucial times. The frequency energy distributions in the first two phases are relatively stable, and are constrained in 0–8.8 Hz and 0–17.8 Hz, respectively. For the third phase, the upper boundary of frequency energy increases in a nearly linear manner, reaching approximately 35 Hz at the end. We calculate synthetic seismograms of the Sanyanyu debris flow. Generally, synthetic seismograms have morphological features and characteristics in key stages similar to those of the actual seismic records, and their maximum values are of the same magnitude. Our results suggest that the seismic source of a debris flow can be represented by a single-force model, and reveal that real-time monitoring and rapid identification of potential debris flows using broadband seismic network records is possible, which can provide approximately 15 min of pre-event warning for local residents and hopefully save many lives.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT The evolution of glaciers and ice sheets depends on processes in the subglacial environment. Shear seismicity along the ice–bed interface provides a window into these processes. Such seismicity requires a rapid loss of strength that is typically ascribed to rate-weakening friction, i.e., decreasing friction with sliding or sliding rate. Many friction experiments have investigated glacial materials at the temperate conditions typical of fast flowing glacier beds. To our knowledge, however, these studies have all found rate-strengthening friction. Here, we investigate the possibility that rate-weakening rock-on-rock friction between sediments frozen to the bottom of the glacier and the underlying water-saturated sediments or bedrock may be responsible for subglacial shear seismicity along temperate glacier beds. We test this ‘entrainment-seismicity hypothesis’ using targeted laboratory experiments and simple models of glacier sliding, seismicity and sediment entrainment. These models suggest that sediment entrainment may be a necessary but not sufficient condition for the occurrence of basal shear seismicity. We propose that stagnation at the Whillans Ice Stream, West Antarctica may be caused by the growth of a frozen fringe of entrained sediment in the ice stream margins. Our results suggest that basal shear seismicity may indicate geomorphic activity.",

      "abstract": "Abstract. Hydraulic processes impact viscous and brittle ice deformation. Water-driven fracturing as well as turbulent water flow within and beneath glaciers radiate seismic waves which provide insights into otherwise hard-to-access englacial and subglacial environments. In this study, we analyze glaciohydraulic tremors recorded by four seismic arrays installed in different parts of Glacier de la Plaine Morte, Switzerland. Data were recorded during the 2016 melt season including the sudden subglacial drainage of an ice-marginal lake. Together with our seismic data, discharge, lake level, and ice flow measurements provide constraints on glacier hydraulics. We find that the tremors are generated by subglacial water flow, in moulins, and by icequake bursts. The dominating process can vary on sub-kilometer and sub-daily scales. Consistent with field observations, continuous source tracking via matched-field processing suggests a gradual up-glacier progression of an efficient drainage system as the melt season progresses. The ice-marginal lake likely connects to this drainage system via hydrofracturing, which is indicated by sustained icequake signals emitted from the proximity of the lake basin and starting roughly 24 h prior to the lake drainage. To estimate the hydraulics associated with the drainage, we use tremor–discharge scaling relationships. Our analysis suggests a pressurization of the subglacial environment at the drainage onset, followed by an increase in the hydraulic radii of the conduits and a subsequent decrease in the subglacial water pressure as the capacity of the drainage system increases. The pressurization is in phase with the drop in the lake level, and its retrieved maximum coincides with ice uplift measured via GPS. Our results highlight the use of cryo-seismology for monitoring glacier hydraulics.\n",

      "abstract": "In recent years the analysis of the variations of seismic background signal recorded in temporal deployments of seismic stations near river channels has proved to be a useful tool to monitor river flow, even for modest discharges. The objective of this work is to apply seismic methods to the characterization of the snowmelt process in the Pyrenees, by developing an innovative approach based on the hierarchical classification of the daily spectrograms. The CANF seismic broad-band station, part of the Geodyn facility in the Laboratorio Subterráneo de Canfranc (LSC), is located in an underground tunnel in the Central Pyrenees, at about 400 m of the Aragón River channel, hence providing an excellent opportunity to explore the possibilities of the seismic monitoring of hydrological events at long term scale. We focus here on the identification and analysis of seismic signals generated by variations in river discharge due to snow melting during a period of six years (2011–2016). During snowmelt episodes, the temporal variations of the discharge at the drainage river result in seismic signals with specific characteristics allowing their discrimination from other sources of background vibrations. We have developed a methodology that use seismic data to monitor the time occurrence and properties of the thawing stages. The proposed method is based on the use of hierarchical clustering techniques to classify the daily seismic spectra according to their similarity. This allows us to discriminate up to four different types of episodes, evidencing changes in the duration and intensity of the melting process which in turn depends on variations in the meteorological and hydrological conditions. The analysis of six years of continuous seismic data from this innovative procedure shows that seismic data can be used to monitor snowmelt on long-term time scale and hence contribute to climate change studies.",

      "abstract": "On 7 April 2016, the Nansen Ice Shelf (NIS) front calved into two icebergs, the first large-scale calving event in >30 years. Three hydrophone moorings were deployed seaward of the NIS in December 2015 and over the following months recorded hundreds of short duration, broadband (10-400 Hz) cryogenic signals, likely caused by fracturing of the ice shelf. The majority of these icequakes occurred between January and early March 2016, several weeks prior to the calving observed by satellite on 7 April. Barometric pressure and wind speed records show the day the icebergs drifted from the NIS coincided with the largest low-pressure storm system recorded in the previous 7 months. A nearby seismic station also shows an increase in low-frequency energy, harmonic tremor, and microseisms on 7 April. Our interpretation is the northern segment of the NIS leading edge broke free during mid-January to February, producing high acoustic energy, but the icebergs remained stationary until a strong low-pressure system with high winds freed the icebergs. As the unpinning of Antarctic ice shelves is not a well-documented process, our observations show that storm systems may play an under-appreciated role in Antarctic ice shelf break-up.",

A correlation has been established between the number of earthquakes recorded by the ASN’s island Arctic stations and SPA0 station. The number of regional earthquakes, recorded by ASN’s island Arctic stations is is smaller in summer-autumn periods than in winter periods.

      "abstract": "Rivers are the fluvial conveyor belts routing sediment across the landscape. While there are proper techniques for continuous estimates of the flux of suspended solids, constraining bedload flux is much more challenging, typically involving extensive measurement infrastructure or labor‐intensive manual measurements. Seismometers are potentially valuable alternatives to in‐stream devices, delivering continuous data with high temporal resolution on the average behavior of a reach. Two models exist to predict the seismic spectra generated by river turbulence and bedload flux. However, these models require estimating a large number of parameters and the spectra usually overlap significantly, which hinders straightforward inversion. We provide three functions contained in the R package “eseis” that allow generic modeling of hydraulic and bedload transport dynamics from seismic data using these models. The underlying Monte Carlo approach creates lookup tables of potential spectra, which are compared against the empirical spectra to identify the best fitting solutions. The method is validated against synthetic data sets and independently measured metrics from the Nahal Eshtemoa, Israel, a flash flood‐dominated ephemeral gravel bed river. Our approach reproduces the synthetic time series with average absolute deviations of 0.01–0.04 m (water depth, ranging between 0 and 1 m) and 0.00–0.04 kg/sm (bedload flux, ranging between 0 and 4 kg/sm). The example flash flood water depths and bedload fluxes are reproduced with respective average deviations of 0.10 m and 0.02 kg/sm. Our approach thus provides generic, testable, and reproducible routines for a quantitative description of key metrics, hard to collect by other techniques in a continuous and representative manner.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Since the 2000s, Greenland ice sheet mass loss has been accelerating, followed by increasing numbers of glacial earthquakes (GEs) at near-grounded glaciers. GEs are caused by calving of km-scale icebergs which capsize against the terminus. Seismic record inversion allows a reconstruction of the history of GE sources which captures capsize dynamics through iceberg-to-terminus contact. When compared with a catalog of contact forces from an iceberg capsize model, seismic force history accurately computes calving volumes while the earthquake magnitude fails to uniquely characterize iceberg size, giving errors up to 1 km3. Calving determined from GEs recorded ateight glaciers in 1993–2013 accounts for up to 21% of the associated discharge and 6% of the Greenland mass loss. The proportion of discharge attributed to capsizing calving may be underestimated by at least 10% as numerous events could not be identified by standard seismic detections (Olsen and Nettles, 2018). While calving production tends to stabilize in East Greenland, Western glaciers have released more and larger icebergs since 2010 and have become major contributors to Greenland dynamic discharge. Production of GEs and calving behavior are controlled by glacier geometry with bigger icebergs being produced when the terminus advances in deepening water. We illustrate how GEs can help in partitioning and monitoring Greenland mass loss and characterizing capsize dynamics.",

      "abstract": "The application of geophysical monitoring technologies may offer an opportunity to understand the dynamic of slopes in response to factors triggering their instability. In this study, Ambient Noise Interferometry was used as a monitoring approach on a man-made reduced-scale vertical slope and on a natural-scale landslide in Sobradinho (Brazil), under the influence of mechanical stress and rainfall, respectively. For both experiments, we adopted similar data acquisition system and processing workflow. After preprocessing of ambient seismic noise, the time-lapse changes were determined in terms of relative velocity changes using the moving window cross spectral technique. For the vertical slope, terrestrial laser scanning was also performed to detect crack or fissure generation. The prototype experiment results showed a decreasing trend of relative velocity changes and reached a minimum value of -0.6% at the end of the experiment. No change was detected on the digital elevation model that was computed from terrestrial laser scanning images, due to the absence of centimeter scale superficial fissures. At natural scale (Sobradinho landslide), no significant variation in relative velocity changes was detected for the rainy and non-rainy days, mainly because of the inadequate change in the degree of saturation, which was found within a relatively short period of data acquisition.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Geophysicists that deploy seismic sensors in ablation zones of glaciers and ice sheets to record glaciogenic signatures can confront recording challenges caused by instrument melt-out or tilt. These challenges often require installing sensors in boreholes to delay melt-out, or securing sensors to structures that improve coupling. We show that some of these structures that were buried near a moulin at a snow-free site in the ablation zone of the Western Greenland Ice Sheet resonated as they became exposed, and caused their geophones to record temporally evolving, narrowband signals that mimic features of glaciogenic sources like moulin tremor. We quantify these artifacts with a mechanical model that shows instruments undergo structural resonance as they melt-out, at exposure rates that we predict from an ablation model (RACMO). These models reproduce general spectral features in our data, and enable us to estimate what instrument exposure reduces ice-to-sensor coupling enough to prevent icequake detection. Last, we use our resonance data to quantitatively measure how narrowband signals that originate from either artificial or glaciogenic sources will reduce the ability of certain waveform detectors (correlators) to capture transient seismic events, even if sensors remain coupled.",

      "abstract": "Two Autonomous Underwater Multi-Dimensional Acoustic Recorders (AUMDAR) were deployed in the southeastern part of Lake Travis during the summer of 2018. Each AUMDAR system possessed a three-axis acoustic vector sensor capable of estimating the azimuthal and vertical arrival angles from discrete sound sources. A unique and complicated propagation environment existed during the experiment due to the mooring locations and the range-dependent lake bathymetry. The AUMDAR systems were almost entirely shielded from sound emanating from surface vessels to the south and southeast of the deployment location, while a larger, yet limited, direct acoustical field of view was realized to the north and northeast. During the evening hours, the low-frequency received level increased without a corresponding increase in the number of detected discrete surface vessels. During the same time, the predominant direction of the received sound pointed toward the bend in the river channel. A three-dimensional ray model was employed to assess the various arrival angles from a grid of source positions located throughout the lake. The model results are consistent with the observations and suggest that the ambient noise field originated from vessels physically located to the northwest of the sensors, but arriving at angles consistent with out-of-plane sound propagation.",

      "abstract": "Deducing relations between the dynamic characteristics of landslides and rockfalls and the resultant high‐frequency (>1 Hz) seismic signal is challenging. To investigate relations that can be tested in the field, we conducted laboratory experiments of 3‐D granular column collapse on a rough inclined thin plate, for a large set of column masses, aspect ratios, particle diameters, and slope angles. The dynamics of the granular flows were recorded using a high‐speed camera, and the generated seismic signal was measured using piezoelectric accelerometers. Empirical scaling laws are established between the characteristics of the granular flows and deposits and that of the generated seismic signals. The radiated seismic energy scales with particle diameter as d3, column mass as M and aspect ratio as a1.1. The increase of the radiated seismic energy as slope angle increases correlates with a similar increase in particle agitation. Based on our experimental results, we revisit scaling laws reported in the field and discuss their possible physical origin. The discrepancy between field and experimental observations can be explained by the complex influence of the substrate on seismic signal and the difference of flow initiation in both cases. However, our empirical scaling laws allow us to determine which flow parameters could be inferred from a given seismic characteristic in the field. In particular, by assuming the flow average speed is known, we show that we can retrieve parameters d, M, and a within a factor of two from the seismic signal.",

      "abstract": "Gravity waves impacting ice shelves illicit a suite of responses that can affect ice shelf integrity. Broadband seismometers deployed on the Ross Ice Shelf, complemented by a near‐icefront seafloor hydrophone, establish the association of strong icequake activity with ocean gravity wave amplitudes (AG) below 0.04 Hz. The Ross Ice Shelf‐front seismic vertical displacement amplitudes (ASV) are well correlated with AG, allowing estimating the frequency‐dependent transfer function from gravity wave amplitude to icefront vertical displacement amplitude (TGSV(f)). TGSV(f) is 0.6–0.7 at 0.001–0.01 Hz but decreases rapidly at higher frequencies. Seismicity of strong icequakes exhibits spatial and seasonal associations with different gravity wave frequency bands, with the strongest icequakes observed at the icefront primarily during the austral summer when sea ice is minimal and swell impacts are strongest.",

      "abstract": "We analyzed 21 rockfalls that occurred in limestone cliffs of the Chartreuse Massif (French Alps). These rockfalls were detected both by Terrestrial Laser Scanning or photogrammetry and by a local seismological network. The combination of these methods allowed us to study relations between rockfall properties (location of detachment and impacts areas, volume, geometry, and propagation) and the induced seismic signal. We observed events with different propagation modes (sliding, mass flow, and free fall) that could be determined from digital elevation models. We focused on events that experienced a free fall after their detachment. We analyzed the first parts of the seismic signals corresponding to the detachment phase and to the first impact. The detachment phase has a smaller amplitude than the impact phase, and its amplitude and duration increases with rockfall volume. By measuring the time delay between the detachment phase and the first impact, we can estimate the free‐fall height. We found a relation Es = aEpb between the potential energy of a rockfall Ep and the seismic energy Es generated during an impact, with a = 10−8 and b = 1.55 and with a correlation coefficient R2 = 0.98. We can thus estimate both the potential energy of a block and its free‐fall height from the seismic signals. By combining these results, we obtain an accurate estimate of the rockfall volume. The relation between the Ep and Es was tested on different geological settings and for larger range of volumes using Yosemite, Mount Granier rockfalls, and with a data set of controlled releases of blocks (Hibert et al., 2017, https://doi.org/10.5194/esurf‐5‐283‐2017, https://www.earth‐surf‐dynam.net/5/283/2017/).",

      "abstract": "Debris flows represent a major hazard in mountainous areas, due to their rapid motion along steep channels and to the transport of large sediment volumes, including large boulders. In this paper, we present data of channelized debris flows characterized by different velocities and sediment concentrations recorded in an instrumented channel reach of the Gadria basin (eastern Italian Alps). From the analysis of the seismic energy produced by the interaction of solid particles with channel boundaries, we show that (i) the peak amplitudes are representative of the kinetic energy of each surge and (ii) most energy transfer occurs during the passage of the surge fronts. Then, we propose a debris flow detection algorithm based on the amplitude information gathered from a linear array of geophones installed along the channel. The short time average over long time average ratio of the seismic signal is used to early detect the debris flow occurrence in a continuous stream of seismic data. The algorithm recognizes moving, long‐lasting sources of ground vibration (i.e., debris flows) and filters out different seismic sources (i.e., anthropic noise, earthquakes, and rockfalls). The alarm is triggered when the short time average/long time average threshold is exceeded on two geophones, progressively with time from upstream to downstream. The algorithm is employed in the early warning system installed for research purposes at Gadria. Complementary data (rainfalls, flow stage measurements, and video recordings) permitted a detailed event characterization and alarm validation. During three monitoring seasons, all debris flows were successfully detected, with the alarm lasting for their entire duration, and no false positives were produced.",

      "abstract": "Ambient noise is useful for characterizing frequency‐dependent noise levels and for assessing data quality for seismic stations. We use 4 years of ambient noise spectra from 16 stations in central Alaska to examine environmental and structural influences on seismic stations. The region contains a major river (Tanana River) that is ice covered for half the year and is underlain by a sedimentary basin (Nenana basin) that strongly influences the seismic wavefield. Nenana basin amplifies ambient seismic noise by 12–16 dB at 0.1–0.7 Hz and 17–30 dB at 0.7–3 Hz. A meteorological station and river gauge at Nenana provide environmental data for comparison with seismic stations. During the summer, the Tanana River produces noise levels elevated by 30–40 dB at frequencies near 10 Hz, as recorded by all five stations within 100 m of the main river channel. The Tanana River sediment is predominantly silt and sand in this region; therefore, we attribute the 10‐Hz river signal to turbulence within the water and to unsteady shearing on the river bottom.

      "abstract": "Subglacial water flow impacts glacier dynamics and shapes the subglacial environment. However, due to the challenges of observing glacier beds, the spatial organization of subglacial water systems and the time scales of conduit evolution and migration are largely unknown. To address these questions, we analyze 1.5‐ to 10‐Hz seismic tremor that we associate with subglacial water flow, hat is, glaciohydraulic tremor, at Taku Glacier, Alaska, throughout the 2016 melt season. We use frequency‐dependent polarization analysis to estimate glaciohydraulic tremor propagation direction (related to the subglacial conduit location) and a degree day melt model to monitor variations in melt‐water input. We suggest that conduit formation requires sustained water input and that multiconduit flow paths can be distinguished from single‐conduit flow paths. Theoretical analysis supports our seismic interpretations that subglacial discharge likely flows through a single‐conduit in regions of steep hydraulic potential gradients but may be distributed among multiple conduits in regions with shallower potential gradients. Seismic tremor in regions with multiple conduits evolves through abrupt jumps between stable configurations that last 3–7 days, while tremor produced by single‐conduit flow remains more stationary. We also find that polarized glaciohydraulic tremor wave types are potentially linked to the distance from source to station and that multiple peak frequencies propagate from a similar direction. Tremor appears undetectable at distances beyond 2–6 km from the source. This new understanding of the spatial organization and temporal development of subglacial conduits informs our understanding of dynamism within the subglacial hydrologic system.",

      "abstract": "Abstract. Avalanches are often released at the dormant stratovolcano Mt. Fuji, which is the highest mountain of Japan (3776 m a.s.l.). These avalanches exhibit different flow types from dry-snow avalanches in winter to slush flows triggered by heavy rainfall in late winter to early spring. Avalanches from different flanks represent a major natural hazard as they can reach large dimensions with run-out distances up to 4 km, destroy parts of the forest, and sometimes damage infrastructure. To monitor the volcanic activity of Mt. Fuji, a permanent and dense seismic network is installed around the volcano. The small distance between the seismic sensors and the volcano flank (<10 km) allowed us to detect numerous avalanche events from the seismic recordings and locate them in time and space. We present the detailed analysis of three avalanche or slush flow periods in the winters of 2014, 2016, and 2018. The largest events (size class 4–5) are detected by the seismic network at maximum distances of about 15 km, and medium-size events (size class 3–4) within a radius of 9 km. To localize the seismic events, we used the automated approach of amplitude source location (ASL) based on the decay of the seismic amplitudes with distance from the moving flow. The recorded amplitudes at each station have to be corrected by the site amplification factors, which are estimated by the coda method using data from local earthquakes. Our results show the feasibility of tracking the flow path of avalanches and slush flows with considerable precision (on the order of magnitude of 100 m) and thus estimating information such as the approximate run-out distance and the average front speed of the flows, which are usually poorly known. To estimate the precision of the seismic tracking, we analyzed aerial photos of the release area and determined the flow path and run-out distance, estimated the release volume from the meteorological records, and conducted numerical simulations with Titan2D to reconstruct the dynamics of the flow. The precision as a function of time is deduced from the comparison with the numerical simulations, showing mean location errors ranging between 85 and 271 m. The average front speeds estimated seismically, which ranged from 27 to 51 m s−1, are consistent with the numerically predicted speeds. In addition, we deduced two scaling relationships based on seismic parameters to quantify the size of the mass flow events. Our results are indispensable for assessing avalanche risk in the Mt. Fuji region as seismic records are often the only available dataset for this natural hazard. The approach presented here could be applied in the development of an early-detection and location system for avalanches based on seismic sensors.\n",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Changing rates of water input can affect both the flow of glaciers and ice sheets and their propensity to crevasse. Here we examine geodetic and seismic observations during two substantial (10–18-times background velocity) rain-induced glacier accelerations at Haupapa/Tasman Glacier, New Zealand. Changes in rain rate result in glacier acceleration and associated uplift, which propagate down-glacier. This pattern of acceleration results in a change to the strain rate field, which correlates with an order of magnitude increase in the apparent seismicity rate and an overall down-glacier migration in located seismicity. After each acceleration event the apparent seismicity rate decreases to below the pre-acceleration rate for 3 days. This suggests that seismic events associated with surface crevasse growth occur early during phases of glacier acceleration due to elevated extensional stresses, and then do not occur again until stresses recover.",

Researchers examined geodetic and seismic data from rain-induced glacier accelerations at Haupapa/Tasman Glacier.

      "abstract": "Abstract. While flowing downhill, a snow avalanche radiates seismic waves in the ground and infrasonic waves in the atmosphere. Seismic energy is radiated by the dense basal layer flowing above the ground, while infrasound energy is likely radiated by the powder front. However, the mutual energy partitioning is not fully understood. We present infrasonic and seismic array data of a powder snow avalanche, which was released on 5 February 2016, in the Dischma valley above Davos, Switzerland. A five-element infrasound array, sensitive above 0.1 Hz, and a seven-element seismic array, sensitive above 4.5 Hz, were deployed at a short distance (<500 m) from each other and close (<1500 m) to the avalanche path. The avalanche dynamics were modelled by using RAMMS (rapid mass movement simulation) and characterized in terms of front velocity and flow height. The use of arrays rather than single sensors allowed us to increase the signal-to-noise ratio and to identify the event in terms of back-azimuth angle and apparent velocity of the recorded wave fields. Wave parameters, derived from array processing, were used to identify the avalanche path and highlight the areas, along the path, where seismic and infrasound energy radiation occurred. The analysis showed that seismic energy is radiated all along the avalanche path, from the initiation to the deposition area, while infrasound is radiated only from a limited sector, where the flow is accelerated and the powder cloud develops. The recorded seismic signal is characterized by scattered back-azimuth angle, suggesting that seismic energy is likely radiated by multiple sources acting at once. On the contrary, the infrasound signal is characterized by a clear variation of back-azimuth angle and apparent velocity. This indicates that infrasound energy radiation is dominated by a moving point source, likely consistent with the powder cloud. Thanks to such clear wave parameters, infrasound is revealed to be particularly efficient for avalanche detection and path identification. While the infrasound apparent velocity decreases as the flow moves downhill, the seismic apparent velocity is quite scattered but decreases to sound velocity during the phase of maximum infrasound radiation. This indicates an efficient process of infrasound to seismic energy transition, which, in our case, increases the recorded seismic amplitude by ∼20 %, at least in our frequency band of analysis. Such an effect can be accounted for when the avalanche magnitude is estimated from seismic amplitude. Presented results clearly indicate how the process of seismo-acoustic energy radiation by a powder avalanche is very complex and likely controlled by the powder cloud formation and dynamics, and the process is hence affected by the path geometry and snow characteristics.\n",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Fast ice flow is associated with the deformation of subglacial sediment. Seismic shear velocities, Vs, increase with the rigidity of material and hence can be used to distinguish soft sediment from hard bedrock substrates. Depth profiles of Vs can be obtained from inversions of Rayleigh wave dispersion curves, from passive or active-sources, but these can be highly ambiguous and lack depth sensitivity. Our novel Bayesian transdimensional algorithm, MuLTI, circumvents these issues by adding independent depth constraints to the inversion, also allowing comprehensive uncertainty analysis. We apply MuLTI to the inversion of a Rayleigh wave dataset, acquired using active-source (Multichannel Analysis of Surface Waves) techniques, to characterise sediment distribution beneath the frontal margin of Midtdalsbreen, an outlet of Norway's Hardangerjøkulen ice cap. Ice thickness (0–20 m) is constrained using co-located GPR data. Outputs from MuLTI suggest that partly-frozen sediment (Vs 500–1000 m s−1), overlying bedrock (Vs 2000–2500 m s−1), is present in patches with a thickness of ~4 m, although this approaches the resolvable limit of our Rayleigh wave frequencies (14–100 Hz). Uncertainties immediately beneath the glacier bed are <280 m s−1, implying that MuLTI cannot only distinguish bedrock and sediment substrates but does so with an accuracy sufficient for resolving variations in sediment properties.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Over a year of seismic observations, ~5000 short duration icequakes were detected by a permanent broadband station installed at the Princess Elisabeth base, located ~180 km inland in eastern Dronning Maud Land, East-Antarctica. Icequake detection via seismic waveform pattern recognition indicates the presence of two dominating clusters of events, totalizing ~1500 icequakes. The corresponding icequake locations point towards two distinct zones of outcropping blue ice areas (BIAs) located respectively at 4 and 1 km from the seismic station, both on the leeward side of a nunatak protruding through the ice sheet. The temporal occurrence of these icequakes suggests a close genetic link with thermal contraction of ice caused by significant surface cooling controlled, in summer by variations in diurnal solar radiation and in winter by strong cooling during cold katabatic regimes. Further analysis demonstrates the dependence of these icequakes on the absolute surface temperature and on its temporal change. Besides providing information on the ice fracture mechanics and rheology, investigations of thermal icequakes may be regarded as a ground-based proxy for the monitoring of the thermal state of BIAs, and characterization of ice-sheet ablation zones.",

Seismic activity is continuous, but peaks occur on falling and rising tides. Beamforming methods reveal that most seismic events originate from two distinct locations, one on the grid-north side of the grounding zone, and one on the grid-south side. The broad pattern of deformation generated as Beardmore Glacier merges with the Ross Ice Shelf results in net extension along the grid-north side of the grounding zone and net compression along the grid-south side. During falling tides, seismic activity peaks on both sides because of increased vertical flexure across the grounding line. During rising tides, seismic activity in the region of extension on the grid-north side is relatively low because the tidal influence on both horizontal strain rate and vertical flexure is small. On the grid-south side during rising tides, however, tidally induced horizontal strain rates promote increased seismicity in regions of long-term compressional flow paths. Our study highlights how concurrent geodetic and seismic measurements provide insight into grounding-zone mechanics and their influence on ice-shelf buttressing.",

      "abstract": "\n Green’s functions provide an efficient way to model surface-wave propagation and estimate physical quantities for near-surface processes. Several surface-wave Green’s function approximations (far-field, no mode conversions and no higher mode surface waves) have been employed for numerous applications such as estimating sediment flux in rivers, determining the properties of landslides, identifying the seismic signature of debris flows or to study seismic noise through cross-correlations. Based on those approximations, simple empirical scalings exist to derive phase velocities and amplitudes for pure power-law velocity structures providing an exact relationship between the velocity model and the Green’s functions. However, no quantitative estimates of the accuracy of these simple scalings have been reported for impulsive sources in complex velocity structures. In this paper, we address this gap by comparing the theoretical predictions to high-order numerical solutions for the vertical component of the wavefield. The Green’s functions computation shows that attenuation-induced dispersion of phase and group velocity plays an important role and should be carefully taken into account to correctly describe how surface-wave amplitudes decay with distance. The comparisons confirm the general reliability of the semi-analytic model for power-law and realistic shear velocity structures to describe fundamental-mode Rayleigh waves in terms of characteristic frequencies, amplitudes and envelopes. At short distances from the source, and for large near-surface velocity gradients or high Q values, the low-frequency energy can be dominated by higher mode surface waves that can be captured by introducing additional higher mode Rayleigh-wave power-law scalings. We also find that the energy spectral density for realistic shear-velocity models close to piecewise power-law models can be accurately modelled using the same non-dimensional scalings. The frequency range of validity of each power-law scaling can be derived from the corresponding phase velocities. Finally, highly discontinuous near-surface velocity profiles can also be approximated by a combination of power-law scalings. Analytical Green’s functions derived from the non-dimensionalization provide a good estimate of the amplitude and variations of the energy distribution, although the predictions are quite poor around the frequency bounds of each power-law scaling.",

      "abstract": "A catastrophic landslide struck the Xiaoba village in Fuquan, Guizhou, southwestern China at about 8:30 p.m. (Beijing Time, UTC + 8) on August 27, 2014. The landslide and induced impulse water waves destroyed two villages and killed 23 persons. By reprocessing seismic signals from a seismic network deployed in the surrounding area of the landslide, we recognized the event from low-frequency seismic signals and subsequently performed a long-period seismic waveform inversion to obtain its force–time history. The inversion results reveal that the maximum force for the landslide is 5 × 10 9  N, and the duration of the landslide is 38.4 s. The landslide reached its maximum velocity of 12.4 m/s at 13.2 s after its initiation, and the mass center plugged into the quarry at 24.2 s. Based on the inversion results, we estimated basal friction of the landslide. We found the friction coefficient rapidly reduces to a relatively steady-state value of ~ 0.4 at a steady-state distance of 35 m and subsequently reduces in a near-linear manner that satisfies the empirical formula $$ \\mu = - 1.4d + 0.44 $$ μ = - 1.4 d + 0.44 , where $$ d $$ d is sliding distance in km. The reduction in friction revealed by the formula is compatible with the finding of previous studies for landslides of similar volume in landslide acceleration stage. However, our result does not make it possible for the friction coefficient to increase again in landslide deceleration stage that a velocity-dependent friction law would allow. The friction variation patterns can be used to constrain input parameters in numerical landslide simulation, which can predicate runout distance and deposit areas for massive landslides to carry out landslide hazard assessment.",

      "abstract": "Recent observations suggest that the nocturnal thermal fracturing of ice occurs at relatively warm temperatures (above −15 °C) at a high‐altitude Himalayan glacier system unless the ice is shielded by a debris mantle. Here we estimate the stresses induced by diurnal temperature variations using viscous, elastic, and two viscoelastic models, and various thicknesses of the debris mantle. Only the elastic and visco‐elastic models are in agreement with the observations. The timing and amplitudes of the stresses in the upper 15 cm of the glacier are different among the models despite the ability of each approach to predict a diurnal increase in tension exceeding the critical threshold proposed for crevasse formation. For example, the elastic stress is several times larger than the viscous stress at the ice surface (650 vs. 250 kPa) and reaches its peak up to 5–6 hr later in the night. The time lag is in line with the seismic records, suggesting that the viscous model is not appropriate. Furthermore, a debris layer of ≥50 cm in thickness suppresses the diurnal fluctuations in thermal stress and therefore protects the ice from mechanical damage. We suggest that high‐amplitude diurnal cooling and weak ice properties due to weathering are essential factors that influence thermal fracturing in the Himalayan environment. The ongoing expansion of seismic networks into cryospheric regions, which will be capable of detecting local thermal‐contraction‐induced cracks, in combination with the fact that such cracks can erode and weaken the ice, and thereby serve as meltwater and heat channels, warrants further research to better understand these near‐surface processes and to monitor ice properties.",

      "abstract": "Coastal cliff erosion is caused by a combination of marine forcing and sub‐aerial processes, but linking cliff erosion to the environmental drivers remains challenging. One key component of these drivers is energy transfer from wave–cliff interaction. The aim of this study is to directly observe cliff ground motion in response to wave impacts at an individual wave scale. Measurements are described from two coastal cliff sites: a 45‐minute pilot study in southern California, USA and a 30‐day deployment in Taranaki, New Zealand. Seismometers, pressure sensors and video are used to compare cliff‐top ground motions with water depth, significant wave height (Hs) and wave impact types to examine cliff ground motion response. Analyses of the dataset demonstrate that individual impact events can be discriminated as discrete events in the seismic signal. Hourly mean ground motion increases with incident Hs, but the largest hourly peak ground motions occurred across a broad range of incident Hs (0.9–3.7 m), including during relatively calm conditions. Mean hourly metrics therefore smooth the short‐term dynamics of wave–cliff interaction; hence, to fully assess wave impact energy transfer to cliffs, it is important also to consider peak ground motion. Video analyses showed that the dominant control on peak ground motion magnitude was wave impact type rather than incident Hs. Wave–cliff impacts where breaking occurs directly onto the cliff face consistently produced greater ground motion compared to broken or unbroken wave impacts: breaking, broken and unbroken impacts averaged peak ground motion of 287, 59 and 38 μm s−1, respectively.

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Subglacial tills play an important role in glacier dynamics but are difficult to characterize in situ. Amplitude Variation with Angle (AVA) analysis of seismic reflection data can distinguish between stiff tills and deformable tills. However, AVA analysis in mountain glacier environments can be problematic: reflections can be obscured by Rayleigh wave energy scattered from crevasses, and complex basal topography can impede the location of reflection points in 2-D acquisitions. We use a forward model to produce challenging synthetic seismic records in order to test the efficacy of AVA in crevassed and geometrically complex environments. We find that we can distinguish subglacial till types in moderately crevassed environments, where ‘moderate’ depends on crevasse spacing and orientation. The forward model serves as a planning tool, as it can predict AVA success or failure based on characteristics of the study glacier. Applying lessons from the forward model, we perform AVA on a seismic dataset collected from Taku Glacier in Southeast Alaska in March 2016. Taku Glacier is a valley glacier thought to overlay thick sediment deposits. A near-offset polarity reversal confirms that the tills are deformable.",

      "abstract": "Abstract. We report on a successful application of the horizontal-to-vertical spectral ratio (H / V) method, generally used to investigate the subsurface velocity structures of the shallow crust, to estimate the Antarctic ice sheet thickness for the first time. Using three-component, five-day long, seismic ambient noise records gathered from more than 60 temporary seismic stations located on the Antarctic ice sheet, the ice thickness measured at each station has comparable accuracy to the Bedmap2 database. Preliminary analysis revealed that 60 out of 65 seismic stations on the ice sheet obtained clear peak frequencies (f0) related to the ice sheet thickness in the H / V spectrum. Thus, assuming that the isotropic ice layer lies atop a high velocity half-space bedrock, the ice sheet thickness can be calculated by a simple approximation formula. About half of the calculated ice sheet thicknesses were consistent with the Bedmap2 ice thickness values. To further improve the reliability of ice thickness measurements, two-type models were built to fit the observed H / V spectrum through non-linear inversion. The two-type models represent the isotropic structures of single- and two-layer ice sheets, and the latter depicts the non-uniform, layered characteristics of the ice sheet widely distributed in Antarctica. The inversion results suggest that the ice thicknesses derived from the two-layer ice models were in good concurrence with the Bedmap2 ice thickness database, and that ice thickness differences between the two were within 300 m at almost all stations. Our results support previous finding that the Antarctic ice sheet is stratified. Extensive data processing indicates that the time length of seismic ambient noise records can be shortened to two hours for reliable ice sheet thickness estimation using the H / V method. This study extends the application fields of the H / V method and provides an effective and independent way to measure ice sheet thickness in Antarctica.",

      "abstract": "Seismological observations offer valuable insights on the stress–strain states, the physical mechanisms and the possible precursory signs of activation of various Earth surface processes (i.e. volcanoes, glaciers and landslides). Comprehensive catalogues of the endogenous land-slide seismicity, that is corresponding to seismic sources generated by the unstable slope from either mechanical or hydrological origins, should include the typology and an estimate of the source parameters (location, magnitude) of the event. These advanced catalogues constitute a strong basis to better describe the slope deformation and its time evolution and better understand the controlling factors. Because the number of seismic events in landslide cat-alogues is generally large, automatic approaches must be considered for deﬁning both the typology and the location of the sources. We propose here a new location approach called Automatic Picking Optimization and Location method—APOLoc for locating landslide endogenous seismic sources from seismological arrays located at close distance. The approach is based on the automatic picking of the P waves arrivals by optimizing the intertrace correlations. The method is tested on calibration shots realized at the Super-Sauze landslide (Southeast French Alps) and compared to other location approaches. By using a realistic velocity model obtained from a seismic tomography campaign, APOLoc reduces the epicentre errors to 23 m (on average) compared to ca . 40 m for the other approaches. APOLoc is then applied for documenting the endogenous seismicity (i.e. slopequakes and rockfalls) at the landslide.",

      "abstract": "Magmatic degassing, typically measured as SO2 flux, plays a key role in controlling volcanic eruption style and is one of the key parameters used by volcano observatories to assess volcanic unrest and detect eruption precursors. Volcanic tremor, the integrated amplitude of seismic energy release over a range of frequencies, is also a key parameter in volcano monitoring. A connection between volcanic degassing and tremor has been inferred through correlations between the signals which are often, but not always, observed during periods of unrest or eruption. However, data are often equivocal and our understanding of the physical processes, which couple degassing with tremor are still evolving. New insights into degassing-tremor coupling can be made by investigation of the long-term relationship between degassing and tremor, focussing on the frequency-dependence of tremor and passive degassing behaviour. In this study, we examine how long-term SO2 emission rates and volcanic tremor on Mt. Etna, track rapid variability in eruptive dynamics. Correlations between SO2 flux and tremor are explored in both quiescent and eruptive periods, comparing the two parameters at both long and short time-scales (<< 1 day) for ~2 years. Our analysis reveals that over month-long timescales passive degassing of SO2 and tremor tend to be well-correlated, but these correlations are lost over shorter timescales. This reflects a coupling process between passive degassing and tremor, produced by a combination of gas flow through permeable magma and the convective flow of magma within the conduit. Short-term correlations are lost because variations in the continuous degassing process are relatively small compared with the overall degassing rate and fall below measurement noise..During eruptive periods strong correlations are observed between degassing and tremor, with a greater contribution of higher frequency signal in tremor, controlled by eruptive style. These observations suggest that in sin-eruptive periods the tremor source is dominated by the coupling between the eruption column and the ground through infrasonic waves, rather than conduit processes. Our results demonstrate the importance of high quality long-term observations and offer new insights into the physical mechanisms which couple degassing and volcanic tremor at active volcanoes.",

However, rapid fracture growth may also lead to sudden and potentially hazardous structural failure of unstable glaciers and ice dams, rifting of ice shelves, or iceberg calving. Here, we use passive seismic recordings to investigate the englacial fracture network on Glacier de la Plaine Morte, Switzerland. Glacier dynamics and the drainage of an ice-marginal lake give rise to numerous icequakes, the majority of which generate dispersed, high-frequency Rayleigh waves. A wide distribution of events allows us to study azimuthal anisotropy between 10 and 30 Hz in order to extract englacial seismic velocities in regions of preferentially oriented crevasses. Beamforming applied to a 100-m-aperture array reveals azimuthal anisotropy of Rayleigh-wave phase velocities reaching a strength of 8% at high frequencies. In addition, we find that the fast direction of wave propagation coincides with the observed surface strike of the narrow crevasses. Forward modeling and inversion of dispersion curves suggest that the azimuthal anisotropy is induced by a 40-m-thick crevassed layer at the surface of the glacier with 8% anisotropy in shear-wave velocity.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Seismograms acquired on the McMurdo Ice Shelf, Antarctica, during an Austral summer melt season (November 2016–January 2017) reveal a diurnal cycle of seismicity, consisting of hundreds of thousands of small ice quakes limited to a 6–12 hour period during the evening, in an area where there is substantial subsurface melting. This cycle is explained by thermally induced bending and fracture of a frozen surface superimposed on a subsurface slush/water layer that is supported by solar radiation penetration and absorption. A simple, one-dimensional model of heat transfer driven by observed surface air temperature and shortwave absorption reproduces the presence and absence (as daily weather dictated) of the observed diurnal seismicity cycle. Seismic event statistics comparing event occurrence with amplitude suggest that the events are generated in a fractured medium featuring relatively low stresses, as is consistent with a frozen surface superimposed on subsurface slush. Waveforms of the icequakes are consistent with hydroacoustic phases at frequency $ {\\bf \\gt} \\bf 75\\,{\\bf Hz}$ and flexural-gravity waves at frequency $ \\bf {\\bf \\lt}25\\,{\\bf Hz}$. Our results suggest that seismic observation may prove useful in monitoring subsurface melting in a manner that complements other ground-based methods as well as remote sensing.",

      "abstract": "A sudden outburst of erosion Glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs) are exactly what they sound like. The sudden emptying of a glacial lake in high-topography regions like the Himalaya can quickly destroy everything in its path. Cook et al. intercepted a GLOF in the Bhotekoshi and Sunkoshi river valleys in central Nepal as they were monitoring the region in the aftermath of the 2015 Gorkha earthquake. They found that a massive amount of erosion occurred during the outburst flood, which suggests that GLOFs may be the primary factor in landscape evolution for these regions. Science, this issue p. 53 A very well monitored Himalayan glacial lake outburst flood shows the power of these large events to drive erosion. Himalayan rivers are frequently hit by catastrophic floods that are caused by the failure of glacial lake and landslide dams; however, the dynamics and long-term impacts of such floods remain poorly understood. We present a comprehensive set of observations that capture the July 2016 glacial lake outburst flood (GLOF) in the Bhotekoshi/Sunkoshi River of Nepal. Seismic records of the flood provide new insights into GLOF mechanics and their ability to mobilize large boulders that otherwise prevent channel erosion. Because of this boulder mobilization, GLOF impacts far exceed those of the annual summer monsoon, and GLOFs may dominate fluvial erosion and channel-hillslope coupling many tens of kilometers downstream of glaciated areas. Long-term valley evolution in these regions may therefore be driven by GLOF frequency and magnitude, rather than by precipitation.",

      "abstract": "Using ambient noise to characterize subsurface structures has revolutionized solid earth seismology. In glacial applications, this technique could provide valuable information about ice thickness and bed properties, which to date are deduced from laborious and/or expensive active source geophysics or deep drilling. Despite challenging conditions such as minimal scattering and changing sources, we show that stacks of cross‐correlation functions of several hours of ambient seismic noise can converge towards Green's functions under favorable conditions. These contain the sought‐after information about subsurface seismic velocities and ice thickness. Applying this technique to two Alpine glaciers in Switzerland, we calculate signal‐to‐noise ratios of noise correlation functions. Faster Green's functions convergence during elevated ambient noise levels suggests that increased surface melt promotes spatially homogeneous excitation of noise sources. With the help of Green's functions amplitude asymmetry as well as standard beamforming, we locate dominant noise sources. In combination with spectrograms, glacier surface velocities from GPS and proglacial water discharge measurements, we find glacier noise in the range from 2 to 8 Hz to be a combination of tremor induced by flowing water, icequakes, and anthropogenic sources. We finally calculate dispersion curves from the cross‐correlation functions to arrive at an estimate of the ice thickness. In combination with H/V spectral ratios, the method shown here allows sampling the depth and the properties of the glacier bed by deploying only two seismometers for several hours. Ambient noise correlations could therefore be a valuable ingredient for studies of glacier and ice sheet beds.",

Previous studies, however, have disagreed about whether the resulting wave-induced stresses may cause ice shelf rift propagation. Most ice shelf rifts show long periods of dormancy suggesting that they have low background stress concentrations and may therefore be susceptible to wave-induced stresses. Here I quantify wave-induced stresses on the Ross Ice Shelf Nascent Rift and the Amery Ice Shelf Loose Tooth T2 Rift using passive seismology. I then relate these stresses to a fracture mechanical model of rift propagation that accounts for rift cohesive strength due to refrozen melange, ice inertia, and spatial heterogeneity in fracture toughness due to the presence of high toughness suture zones. I infer wave-induced stresses using the wave impedance tensor, a rank three tensor that relates seismically observable particle velocities to components of the stress tensor. I find that wave-induced stresses are an order of magnitude larger on the Ross Ice Shelf as compared to the Amery Ice Shelf. In the absence of additional rift strength, my model predicts that the Nascent Rift should have experienced extensive rift propagation. The observation that no such propagation occurred during this time therefore suggests that the Nascent Rift experiences strengthening from either refrozen melange or rift tip processes zone dynamics. This study illustrates one way in which passive seismology may illuminate glacier calving physics.",

      "abstract": "Shale oil and gas exploitation by hydraulic fracturing experienced a strong development worldwide over the last years, accompanied by a substantial increase of related induced seismicity, either consequence of fracturing or wastewater injection. In Europe, unconventional hydrocarbon resources remain underdeveloped and their exploitation controversial. In UK, fracturing operations were stopped after the Mw 2.3 Blackpool induced earthquake; in Poland, operations were halted in 2017 due to adverse oil market conditions. One of the last operated well at Wysin, Poland, was monitored independently in the framework of the EU project SHEER, through a multidisciplinary system including seismic, water and air quality monitoring. The hybrid seismic network combines surface mini-arrays, broadband and shallow borehole sensors. This paper summarizes the outcomes of the seismological analysis of these data. Shallow artificial seismic noise sources were detected and located at the wellhead active during the fracturing stages. Local microseismicity was also detected, located and characterised, culminating in two events of Mw 1.0 and 0.5, occurring days after the stimulation in the vicinity of the operational well, but at very shallow depths. A sharp methane peak was detected ~19 hours after the Mw 0.5 event. No correlation was observed between injected volumes, seismicity and groundwater parameters.",

Apart from estimating the overall activity, information on the location of individual events is also important. We deployed a seismic monitoring system consisting of seven vertical geophones at a site above Davos, Switzerland. During a major snowfall on 2017 March 9 and 10, we visually identified 19 events in the seismic data that we considered as avalanches. For all these events, we calculated the backazimuth angles as well as the apparent velocity of the incoming wavefields using two different array processing techniques: a commonly used beamforming approach and multiple signal classification (MUSIC). One of the avalanches released directly above the array and the path was well documented in a field survey. We analysed this event in more detail and compared both array processing techniques. Using the MUSIC method we were able to reproduce the avalanche path with reasonable accuracy, whereas the beam-forming method only provided a rough direction. The results obtained using MUSIC suggest that with our seismic array mainly infrasonic waves were recorded during the event. From the remaining 18 events, 15 had a clear path and were classified as avalanches. The other three events were dismissed as falsely classified avalanches. By comparing the results for these 15 avalanches events with our field survey, we were able to map 11 avalanches within a distance of 3 km of the array.",

The multiple signal classification (MUSIC) method was used to analyze the recorded data and determine the location of avalanches.

      "abstract": "Scientifically valuable information can be learned by listening to the tiny vibrations emanating from a glacier with seismometers. However, this approach has never been employed to better understand glaciers protected from heat by a debris mantle, despite being common in the Himalayas, one of the most glacierized regions in the world. Here we installed a seismic network at a series of challenging high‐altitude sites on a glacier in Nepal. Our results show that the diurnal air temperature modulates the glacial seismic noise. The exposed surface of the glacier experiences thermal contraction when the glacier cools, whereas the areas that are insulated with thick debris do not suffer such thermal stress. Thus, the unprotected ice surface bursts with seismicity every night due to cracking, which gradually damages and weathers the ice. This is the first time such processes have been observed at relatively warm temperatures and outside of the polar regions.",

Researchers deployed a seismic network on a glacier in Nepal to record ambient vibrations.

      "abstract": "The capsizing of icebergs calved from marine‐terminating glaciers generate horizontal forces on the glacier front, producing long‐period seismic signals referred to as glacial earthquakes. These forces can be estimated by broadband seismic inversion, but their interpretation in terms of magnitude and waveform variability is not straightforward. We present a numerical model for fluid drag that can be used to study buoyancy‐driven iceberg capsize dynamics and the generated contact forces on a calving face using the finite‐element approach. We investigate the sensitivity of the force to drag effects, iceberg geometry, calving style, and initial buoyancy. We show that there is no simple relationship between force amplitude and iceberg volume, and similar force magnitudes can be reached for different iceberg sizes. The force history and spectral content varies with the iceberg attributes. The iceberg aspect ratio primarily controls the capsize dynamics, the force shape, and force frequency, whereas the iceberg height has a stronger impact on the force magnitude. Iceberg hydrostatic imbalance generates contact forces with specific frequency peaks that explain the variability in glacial earthquake dominant frequency. For similar icebergs, top‐out and bottom‐out events have significantly different capsize dynamics leading to larger top‐out forces especially for thin icebergs. For realistic iceberg dimensions, we find contact‐force magnitudes that range between 5.6 × 1011 and 2 × 1014 kg·m, consistent with seismic observations. This study provides a useful framework for interpreting glacial earthquake sources and estimating the ice mass loss from coupled analysis of seismic signals and modeling results.",

      "abstract": "We have analyzed the impact of different forcings, such as rain and seismicity, on slope instabilites on an active volcano. For this, we compiled a catalog of the locations and volumes of rockfalls in the Piton de la Fournaise crater using seismic records. We validated it by comparing the locations and volumes to those deduced from photogrammetric data. We analyzed 10,477 rockfalls, spanning the period 2014 to 2016. This period corresponds to the renewal of volcanic activity after a 41‐month rest. Our analysis reveals that renewed eruptive activity has unsettled the crater edges. External forcings such as rain and seismicity are shown to potentially increase the number and the volume of rockfalls, with a stronger impact on the volume. Preeruptive seismicity seems to be the main triggering factor for the largest volumes, with a delay of one to several days. Rain alone does not seem to trigger especially large rockfalls. We infer that repetitive vibrations from the many seismic events, combined with the action of rain, induce crack (or slip) growth in highly fractured (or granular) materials, leading to the collapse of large volumes. Regarding their spatial distribution before an eruption, the largest rockfalls seem to migrate toward the location of magma extrusion.",

However, inversions of sediment transport rates from seismic observations have not been fully tested against independent measurements, and thus have unknown but potentially large uncertainties. In the present study, we provide the first robust test of existing theory by conducting dedicated sediment transport experiments in a flume laboratory under fully turbulent and rough flow conditions. We monitor grain‐scale physics with the use of ‘smart rocks’ that consist of accelerometers embedded into manufactured rocks, and we quantitatively link bedload mechanics and seismic observations under various prescribed flow and sediment transport conditions. From our grain‐scale observations, we find that bedload grain hop times are widely distributed, with impacts being on average much more frequent than predicted by existing saltation models. Impact velocities are observed to be a linear function of average downstream cobble velocities, and both velocities show a bed‐slope dependency that is not represented in existing saltation models. Incorporating these effects in an improved bedload‐induced seismic noise model allows sediment flux to be inverted from seismic noise within a factor of two uncertainty. This result holds over nearly two orders of magnitude of prescribed sediment fluxes with different sediment sizes and channel‐bed slopes, and particle–particle collisions observed at the highest investigated rates are found to have negligible effect on the generated seismic power. These results support the applicability of the seismic‐inversion framework to mountain rivers, although further experiments remain to be conducted at sediment transport near transport capacity. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

Catastrophic events that generate long-period seismic radiation have been studied in detail, and monitoring systems have been developed for applications on a very local scale. Here we demonstrate that similar techniques can also be applied to regional seismic networks, which show great potential for real-time and large-scale monitoring and analysis of rockslide activity. This paper studies 19 moderate-sized to large rockslides in the Eastern Alps that were recorded by regional seismic networks within distances of a few tens of kilometers to more than 200 km. We develop a simple and fully automatic processing chain that detects, locates, and classifies rockslides based on vertical-component seismic records. We show that a kurtosis-based onset picker is suitable to detect the very emergent onsets of rockslide signals and to locate the rockslides within a few kilometers from the true origin using a grid search and a 1-D seismic velocity model. Automatic discrimination between rockslides and local earthquakes is possible by a combination of characteristic parameters extracted from the seismic records, such as kurtosis or maximum-to-mean amplitude ratios. We attempt to relate the amplitude of the seismic records to the documented rockslide volume and reveal a potential power law in agreement with earlier studies. Since our approach is based on simplified methods we suggest and discuss how each step of the automatic processing could be expanded and improved to achieve more detailed results in the future.\n",

      "abstract": "Shear strains, among other ground motions, can be induced by weather‐related processes. As a result, broadband seismic data offer a unique tool for understanding these natural weather events. Here we used continuous seismic, meteorological, and stream data to analyze weather‐related ground motions during typhoons and rainy seasons in Taiwan. In addition to high‐frequency signals, we detected ultralong period seismic signals at the station Mahsi (MASB) during three meteorological events: Typhoon Kalmaegi in 2008, Typhoon Morakot in 2009, and the East Asian rainy season in 2012. Seismic velocity signals with frequencies lower than 0.3 mHz correlate with precipitation and with the time derivative of the water level in a nearby river. We converted the seismic signals to ground tilt and found that the tilt correlates with the time history of river water level, which fluctuates with precipitation. The seismically derived tilt ranges from 10−8 to 10−7 radians, consistent with an analytic circular loading model, indicating water level fluctuations of higher than 1 m in the small river 30 m away from MASB. To quantify precipitation using seismic data, we successfully modeled seismic waveforms using an empirical Green's function method, which gives good fits to both main event seismic waveforms and precipitation time history. This work demonstrates that continuous recordings from broadband seismometers may help determine local fluvial water load and could be useful for decadal rainfall change research.",

We review the studies where seismic instruments have been\ninstalled on unstable slopes and discuss the choice of the seismic\ninstruments and the network geometries. Seismic observations acquired at 13\nunstable slopes are analyzed in order to construct the proposed typology. The\nselected slopes are affected by various landslide types (slide, fall, topple\nand flow) triggered in various material (from unconsolidated soils to\nconsolidated rocks). We investigate high-frequency bands (>1 Hz) where\nmost of the seismic energy is recorded at the 1 km sensor to source\ndistances. Several signal properties (duration, spectral content and\nspectrogram shape) are used to describe the sources. We observe that similar\ngravitational processes generate similar signals at different slopes. Three\nmain classes can be differentiated mainly from the length of the signals, the\nnumber of peaks and the duration of the autocorrelation. The classes are the\n“slopequake” class, which corresponds to sources potentially occurring\nwithin the landslide body; the “rockfall” class, which corresponds to\nsignals generated by rock block impacts; and the “granular flow” class,\nwhich corresponds to signals generated by wet or dry debris/rock flows.\nSubclasses are further proposed to differentiate specific signal properties\n(frequency content, resonance, precursory signal). The signal properties of\neach class and subclass are described and several signals of the same class\nrecorded at different slopes are presented. Their potential origins are\ndiscussed. The typology aims to serve as a standard for further comparisons\nof the endogenous microseismicity recorded on landslides.\n",

      "abstract": "Abstract. Snow avalanches generate seismic signals as many other mass movements.\nDetection of avalanches by seismic monitoring is highly relevant to assess\navalanche danger. In contrast to other seismic events, signals generated by\navalanches do not have a characteristic first arrival nor is it possible to\ndetect different wave phases. In addition, the moving source character of\navalanches increases the intricacy of the signals. Although it is possible to\nvisually detect seismic signals produced by avalanches, reliable automatic\ndetection methods for all types of avalanches do not exist yet. We therefore\nevaluate whether hidden Markov models (HMMs) are suitable for the automatic\ndetection of avalanches in continuous seismic data. We analyzed data recorded\nduring the winter season 2010 by a seismic array deployed in an avalanche\nstarting zone above Davos, Switzerland. We re-evaluated a reference catalogue\ncontaining 385 events by grouping the events in seven probability classes.\nSince most of the data consist of noise, we first applied a simple amplitude\nthreshold to reduce the amount of data. As first classification results were\nunsatisfying, we analyzed the temporal behavior of the seismic signals for\nthe whole data set and found that there is a high variability in the seismic\nsignals. We therefore applied further post-processing steps to reduce the\nnumber of false alarms by defining a minimal duration for the detected event,\nimplementing a voting-based approach and analyzing the coherence of the\ndetected events. We obtained the best classification results for events\ndetected by at least five sensors and with a minimal duration of\n 12 s . These processing steps allowed identifying two periods of\nhigh avalanche activity, suggesting that HMMs are suitable for the automatic\ndetection of avalanches in seismic data. However, our results also showed that\nmore sensitive sensors and more appropriate sensor locations are needed to\nimprove the signal-to-noise ratio of the signals and therefore the\nclassification.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Retreating glaciers are a consequence of a warming climate. Thus, numerous monitoring campaigns are being carried out to increase understanding of this on-going process. One phenomenon related to dynamic glacial changes is glacier-induced seismicity; however, weak seismic events are difficult to record due to the sparse seismological network in arctic areas. We have developed an automatic procedure capable of detecting glacier-induced seismic events using records from a single permanent seismological station. To distinguish between glacial and non-glacial signals, we developed a fuzzy logic algorithm based on the signal frequency and energy flow analysis. We studied the long-term changes in glacier-induced seismicity in Hornsund (southern Spitsbergen) and in Kongsfjorden (western Spitsbergen). We found that the number of detected glacial-origin events in the Hornsund dataset over the years 2013-14 has doubled. In the Kongsfjorden dataset, we observed a steady increase in the number of glacier-induced events with each year. We also observed that the seasonal event distribution correlates best with 1 month lagged temperatures, and that extreme rain events can intensify seismic emissions. Our study demonstrates the possibility of using long-term seismological observations from a single permanent station to automatically monitor the dynamic activity of nearby glaciers and retrieve its characteristic features.",
      "summary": "This study explores the use of seismological data to monitor glacier dynamics. An automated procedure was developed to detect glacier-induced seismic events from a single station. Fuzzy logic was applied to distinguish glacial signals based on frequency and energy.

      "abstract": "Abstract. The Swiss plate geophone system is a bedload surrogate measuring technique that has been installed in more than 20 streams, primarily in the European Alps. Here we report about calibration measurements performed in two mountain streams in Austria. The Fischbach and Ruetz gravel-bed streams are characterized by important runoff and bedload transport during the snowmelt season. A total of 31 (Fischbach) and 21 (Ruetz) direct bedload samples were obtained during a 6-year period. Using the number of geophone impulses and total transported bedload mass for each measurement to derive a calibration function results in a strong linear relation for the Fischbach, whereas there is only a poor linear calibration relation for the Ruetz measurements. Instead, using geophone impulse rates and bedload transport rates indicates that two power law relations best represent the Fischbach data, depending on transport intensity; for lower transport intensities, the same power law relation is also in reasonable agreement with the Ruetz data. These results are compared with data and findings from other field sites and flume studies. We further show that the observed coarsening of the grain size distribution with increasing bedload flux can be qualitatively reproduced from the geophone signal, when using the impulse counts along with amplitude information. Finally, we discuss implausible geophone impulse counts that were recorded during periods with smaller discharges without any bedload transport, and that are likely caused by vehicle movement very near to the measuring sites.",

The study also explores grain size distribution and discusses potential sources of error in geophone measurements.",

Deformation within the instability is accommodated by sliding,\nwhereby weak seismic energies are released through material deformation.\nThus, passive microseismic monitoring provides information that relates to\nthe slope dynamics. In this study, passive microseismic data acquired at\nSuper-Sauze (southeastern France) and Pechgraben (Upper Austria) slow-moving\nclay-rich debris slides (“clayey landslides”) are investigated.\nObservations are benchmarked against previous similar case studies to provide a\ncomprehensive and homogenized typology of microseismic signals at clayey\nlandslides.

The complexity of seismic velocity structures, the low quantity and low\nquality of available signal onsets and non-optimal seismic network geometry\nseverely impedes the source location procedure; thus, rendering source\nprocesses characterization challenging.

      "abstract": "Abstract. Monitoring sediment transport processes in rivers is of particular interest\nto engineers and scientists to assess the stability of rivers and hydraulic\nstructures. Various methods for sediment transport process description were\nproposed using conventional or surrogate measurement techniques. This paper\naddresses the topic of the passive acoustic monitoring of bedload transport\nin rivers and especially the estimation of the bedload grain size\ndistribution from self-generated noise. It discusses the feasibility of\nlinking the acoustic signal spectrum shape to bedload grain sizes involved in\nelastic impacts with the river bed treated as a massive slab. Bedload grain\nsize distribution is estimated by a regularized algebraic inversion scheme\nfed with the power spectrum density of river noise estimated from one\nhydrophone. The inversion methodology relies upon a physical model that\npredicts the acoustic field generated by the collision between rigid bodies.\nHere we proposed an analytic model of the acoustic energy spectrum generated\nby the impacts between a sphere and a slab. The proposed model computes the\npower spectral density of bedload noise using a linear system of analytic\nenergy spectra weighted by the grain size distribution. The algebraic system\nof equations is then solved by least square optimization and solution\nregularization methods. The result of inversion leads directly to the\nestimation of the bedload grain size distribution. The inversion method was\napplied to real acoustic data from passive acoustics experiments realized on\nthe Isere River, in France. The inversion of in situ measured spectra\nreveals good estimations of grain size distribution, fairly close to what was\nestimated by physical sampling instruments. These results illustrate the\npotential of the hydrophone technique to be used as a standalone method that\ncould ensure high spatial and temporal resolution measurements for sediment\ntransport in rivers.",

      "abstract": "Rain-induced accelerations of Haupapa/Tasman Glacier are accompanied by abundant seismicity. This seismicity reveals some of the glacial processes occurring at times of accelerated glacier sliding and those related directly to surficial water inputs.To study the processes occurring during rain-induced accelerations a network of seismic and geodetic sensors was deployed on the lower Haupapa/Tasman Glacier for four months in 2016. Seven categories of seismicity were defined during the study period. Glacier source processes were inferred for these categories based on their waveform characteristics, and each source was then compared to meteoric and geodetic data to discern spatial and temporal relationships. Of the seven categories of seismicity only the seismic events associated with crevasse opening were found to correlate with rain rate. Increased crevassing rate likely results from two factors: 1) increased extensional strain rates following the propagation of a subglacial cavitation front during transient accelerations and 2) hydrofracture due to the accumulation of rain in crevasses. Strain-driven crevassing is associated only with glacier acceleration, but crevasse opening via hydrofracture is inferred to occur independently of strain changes such that it is an active process at any point following heavy rainfall. Basal seismicity was not observed to respond to changes in glacier velocity or inferred subglacial water pressure, although this may be due to limitations in the seismic event detection technique.",

      "abstract": "Measurements and mechanical models of heterogeneous bedload transport in rivers remain basic challenges for studies of landscape evolution and watershed management. A 700 m reach of the Trinity River (northern California, USA), a large gravel-bed river, was instrumented with an array of 76 seismographs during a dam-controlled ﬂood and gravel augmentation to investigate the potential for out-of-stream monitoring. The temporal response to gravel augmentation during constant discharge provides strong evidence of seismic sensitivity to bedload transport and aids in identification of the seismic frequencies most sensitive to bedload in the study area. Following gravel augmentations, the seismic array reveals a period of enhanced transport that spans most or all of the reach for ∼7–10 h. Neither the duration nor the downstream extent of enhanced transport would have been constrained without the seismic array. Sensitivity to along-stream transport variations is further demonstrated by seismic amplitudes that decrease between the upper and lower halves of the reach consistent with decreased bedload ﬂux constrained by time-lapse bathymetry. Insight into the magnitude of impact energy that reaches the bed is also gained from the seismic array. Observed peak seismic power is ∼1%–5% of that predicted by a model of saltation over exposed bedrock. Our results suggest that dissipation of impact energy due to cover effects needs to be considered to seismically constrain bedload transport rates, and that noninvasive constraints from seismology can be used to test and refine mechanical models of bedload transport.",

      "abstract": "Seismic data show that subglacial sediment slip causes a complex flow response of the Greenland Ice Sheet to climate warming. The land-terminating margin of the Greenland Ice Sheet has slowed down in recent decades, although the causes and implications for future ice flow are unclear. Explained originally by a self-regulating mechanism where basal slip reduces as drainage evolves from low to high efficiency, recent numerical modeling invokes a sedimentary control of ice sheet flow as an alternative hypothesis. Although both hypotheses can explain the recent slowdown, their respective forecasts of a long-term deceleration versus an acceleration of ice flow are contradictory. We present amplitude-versus-angle seismic data as the first observational test of the alternative hypothesis. We document transient modifications of basal sediment strengths by rapid subglacial drainages of supraglacial lakes, the primary current control on summer ice sheet flow according to our numerical model. Our observations agree with simulations of initial postdrainage sediment weakening and ice flow accelerations, and subsequent sediment restrengthening and ice flow decelerations, and thus confirm the alternative hypothesis. Although simulated melt season acceleration of ice flow due to weakening of subglacial sediments does not currently outweigh winter slowdown forced by self-regulation, they could dominate over the longer term. Subglacial sediments beneath the Greenland Ice Sheet must therefore be mapped and characterized, and a sedimentary control of ice flow must be evaluated against competing self-regulation mechanisms.",

      "abstract": "Abstract. Seismic monitoring of mass movements can significantly help to mitigate the associated hazards; however, the link between event dynamics and the seismic signals generated is not completely understood. To better understand these relationships, we conducted controlled releases of single blocks within a soft-rock (black marls) gully of the Rioux-Bourdoux torrent (French Alps). A total of 28 blocks, with masses ranging from 76 to 472 kg, were used for the experiment. An instrumentation combining video cameras and seismometers was deployed along the travelled path. The video cameras allow reconstructing the trajectories of the blocks and estimating their velocities at the time of the different impacts with the slope. These data are compared to the recorded seismic signals. As the distance between the falling block and the seismic sensors at the time of each impact is known, we were able to determine the associated seismic signal amplitude corrected for propagation and attenuation effects. We compared the velocity, the potential energy lost, the kinetic energy and the momentum of the block at each impact to the true amplitude and the radiated seismic energy. Our results suggest that the amplitude of the seismic signal is correlated to the momentum of the block at the impact. We also found relationships between the potential energy lost, the kinetic energy and the seismic energy radiated by the impacts. Thanks to these relationships, we were able to retrieve the mass and the velocity before impact of each block directly from the seismic signal. Despite high uncertainties, the values found are close to the true values of the masses and the velocities of the blocks. These relationships allow for gaining a better understanding of the physical processes that control the source of high-frequency seismic signals generated by rockfalls.",

      "abstract": "Abstract. Heavy precipitation can mobilize tens to hundreds of thousands of cubic meters of sediment in steep Alpine torrents in a short time. The resulting debris flows (mixtures of water, sediment and boulders) move downstream with velocities of several meters per second and have a high destruction potential. Warning protocols for affected communities rely on raising awareness about the debris-flow threat, precipitation monitoring and rapid detection methods. The latter, in particular, is a challenge because debris-flow-prone torrents have their catchments in steep and inaccessible terrain, where instrumentation is difficult to install and maintain. Here we test amplitude source location (ASL) as a processing scheme for seismic network data for early warning purposes. We use debris-flow and noise seismograms from the Illgraben catchment, Switzerland, a torrent system which produces several debris-flow events per year. Automatic in situ detection is currently based on geophones mounted on concrete check dams and radar stage sensors suspended above the channel. The ASL approach has the advantage that it uses seismometers, which can be installed at more accessible locations where a stable connection to mobile phone networks is available for data communication. Our ASL processing uses time-averaged ground vibration amplitudes to estimate the location of the debris-flow front. Applied to continuous data streams, inversion of the seismic amplitude decay throughout the network is robust and efficient, requires no manual identification of seismic phase arrivals and eliminates the need for a local seismic velocity model. We apply the ASL technique to a small debris-flow event on 19 July 2011, which was captured with a temporary seismic monitoring network. The processing rapidly detects the debris-flow event half an hour before arrival at the outlet of the torrent and several minutes before detection by the in situ alarm system. An analysis of continuous seismic records furthermore indicates that detectability of Illgraben debris flows of this size is unaffected by changing environmental and anthropogenic seismic noise and that false detections can be greatly reduced with simple processing steps.",

      "abstract": "Rockfall in deglaciated mountain valleys is perhaps the most important post-glacial geomorphic process for determining the rates and patterns of valley wall erosion. Furthermore, rockfall poses a significant hazard to inhabitants and motivates the monitoring for rockfall occurrence in populated areas. Traditional rockfall detection methods, such as aerial photography and Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS) data evaluation provide constraints on the location and released volume of rock, but have limitations due to significant time lags or integration times between surveys, and deliver limited information on rockfall triggering mechanisms and the dynamics of individual events. Environmental seismology, the study of seismic signals emitted by processes at the Earth's surface, provides a complementary solution to these shortcomings. This approach is limited amongst others by the strength of the signals emitted by a source and their transformation and attenuation towards receivers. To test the ability of seismic methods to identify and locate small rockfalls, and to characterise their dynamics, we surveyed a 2.16 km 2 large, near vertical cliff section of the Lauterbrunnen Valley in the Swiss Alps with a TLS and six broadband seismometers. During 37 days in autumn 2014, ten TLS-detected rockfalls with volumes ranging from 0.053 p 0.004 to 2.338 p 0.085 m 3 were independently detected and located by the seismic approach, with a deviation of 81 −29 +59  m (about 7 % of the average inter-station distance of the seismometer network). Further potential rockfalls were detected outside the TLS-surveyed cliff area. The onset of individual events can be determined within a few milliseconds, and their dynamics can be resolved into distinct phases, such as detachment, free fall, intermittent impact, fragmentation, arrival at the talus slope and subsequent slope activity. The small rockfall volumes in this area require significant supervision during data processing: 2175 initially picked potential events reduced to 511 potential events after applying automatic rejection criteria. The 511 events needed to be inspected manually to reveal 19 short earthquakes and 37 potential rockfalls, including the ten TLS-detected events. Rockfalls do not show a relationship to released seismic energy or peak amplitude at this spatial scale due to the dominance of process-inherent factors, such as fall height, degree of fragmentation and distribution, and subsequent talus slope activity. The combination of TLS and environmental seismology provides a detailed validation of seismic detection of small volume rockfalls, and revealed unprecedented temporal, spatial and geometric details about rockfalls in steep mountainous terrain.",

However, the processing of the raw signal alters in different ways the original raw data, depending on the processing method adopted.

      "abstract": "Heavy precipitation can suddenly mobilize tens to hundreds of thousands of cubic meters of sediments in steep Alpine torrents. The resulting debris flows (mixtures of water, sediments and boulders) move downstream with velocities of 15 several meters per second and have a high destructive potential. Warning schemes for affected communities rely on raising awareness to the debris flow threat, precipitation monitoring and rapid detection methods. The latter, in particular, remain an ongoing challenge, because debris-flow-prone torrents have their catchments in steep and inaccessible terrain, where installing and maintaining instrumentation is difficult. Here, we propose a simple processing scheme for seismic network data. We use debris flow and noise seismograms from Illgraben, Switzerland, a torrent, which produces several debris flow 20 events per year. Automatic in-situ detection is currently based on geophones mounted on concrete check dams and radar stage sensors hung above the channel. The proposed approach has the advantage that it uses seismometers, which can be installed at more accessible locations, and where a stable connection to portable phone networks is available for data communication. Our data processing uses time-averaged ground vibration amplitudes to estimate the location of the debris flow front. Applied to continuous data streams, inversion of the seismic amplitude decay eliminates the need for single25 station-based detection and knowledge of the local seismic velocity model. This makes the approach suitable for automation, as seismic phase identification is unnecessary and the amplitude averaging significantly reduces data volume. We apply our approach to a small debris flow event on 19 July 2011, which was captured with a temporary monitoring network. The processing rapidly detects the debris flow event half an hour before its front arrives at the torrent mouth and 8 minutes before detection by the current alarm system. An analysis of continuous seismic records furthermore indicates that detectability of 30 Illgraben debris flows of this size are unaffected by changing environmental and cultural seismic noise. We therefore propose that our method reliably detects initiation of the Illgraben debris flows and can thus form an important ingredient in the next generation of early warning schemes. Nat.

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Fractured systems developing at the base of temperate glaciers play a significant role in the transport of subglacial water. Their influence on dynamics and hydraulics of glaciers and the seasonal alterations they experience during the hydrological year, remain however, poorly understood, as they lay beyond the reach of most conventional glaciological techniques. In this work, we investigate the seasonal evolution of glacier seismicity in the ablation zone of Rhonegletscher (Switzerland) and focus on basal fracture processes. To do this, we use seismic measurements performed between June 2012 and July 2013 and complementary measurements of surface motion and changes in melt water input inferred from degree day modeling. Results of a spectrogram analysis highlight predominant seismic emissions until end of October 2012 and from mid April 2013 in line with measured surface velocities, and indicate a rapid adaptation of the basal drainage system at initiation and end of the winter period. The analysis of icequakes emitted from two active regions shows that the basal events, due to opening and closing of cracks within fracture networks, persist after winter initiation, and points out the year-long preservation of the associated sources. In this regard, we deduce that basal crack networks aseismically evolve during the winter period.",

      "abstract": "Abstract. In seismology, the signal is usually analysed for earthquake data, but earthquakes represent less than 1 % of continuous recording. The remaining data are considered as seismic noise and were for a long time ignored. Over the past decades, the analysis of seismic noise has constantly increased in popularity, and this has led to the development of new approaches and applications in geophysics. The study of continuous seismic records is now open to other disciplines, like geomorphology. The motion of mass at the Earth's surface generates seismic waves that are recorded by nearby seismometers and can be used to monitor mass transfer throughout the landscape. Surface processes vary in nature, mechanism, magnitude, space and time, and this variability can be observed in the seismic signals. This contribution gives an overview of the development and current opportunities for the seismic monitoring of geomorphic processes. We first describe the common principles of seismic signal monitoring and introduce time–frequency analysis for the purpose of identification and differentiation of surface processes. Second, we present techniques to detect, locate and quantify geomorphic events. Third, we review the diverse layout of seismic arrays and highlight their advantages and limitations for specific processes, like slope or channel activity. Finally, we illustrate all these characteristics with the analysis of seismic data acquired in a small debris-flow catchment where geomorphic events show interactions and feedbacks. Further developments must aim to fully understand the richness of the continuous seismic signals, to better quantify the geomorphic activity and to improve the performance of warning systems. Seismic monitoring may ultimately allow the continuous survey of erosion and transfer of sediments in the landscape on the scales of external forcing.",

      "abstract": "Glacier microseismicity is a promising tool to study glacier dynamics. However, physical processes connecting seismic signals and ice dynamics are not clearly understood at present. Particularly, the relationship between tide‐modulated seismicity and dynamics of calving glaciers remains elusive. Here we analyze records from an on‐ice seismometer placed 250 m from the calving front of Bowdoin Glacier, Greenland. Using high‐frequency glacier flow speed measurements, we show that the microseismic activity is related to strain rate variations. The seismic activity correlates with longitudinal stretching measured at the glacier surface. Both higher melt rates and falling tides accelerate glacier motion and increase longitudinal stretching. Long‐term microseismic monitoring could therefore provide insights on how a calving glacier's force balance and flow regime react to changes at the ice‐ocean interface.",

They found a correlation between microseismic activity and strain rate variations linked to tidal cycles.

      "abstract": "Abstract. We carry out a combined analysis of the short- and long-period seismic signals generated by the devastating Oso-Steelhead landslide that occurred on 22 March 2014. The seismic records show that the Oso-Steelhead landslide was not a single slope failure, but a succession of multiple failures distinguished by two major collapses that occurred approximately 3 min apart. The first generated long-period surface waves that were recorded at several proximal stations. We invert these long-period signals for the forces acting at the source, and obtain estimates of the first failure runout and kinematics, as well as its mass after calibration against the mass-centre displacement estimated from remote-sensing imagery. Short-period analysis of both events suggests that the source dynamics of the second event is more complex than the first. No distinct long-period surface waves were recorded for the second failure, which prevents inversion for its source parameters. However, by comparing the seismic energy of the short-period waves generated by both events we are able to estimate the volume of the second. Our analysis suggests that the volume of the second failure is about 15–30% of the total landslide volume, giving a total volume mobilized by the two events between 7 × 106 and 10 × 106 m3, in agreement with estimates from ground observations and lidar mapping.",

Infrasound has been applied to avalanche research and monitoring for the last 20 years but it never turned into an operational tool to identify clear signals related to avalanches. We present here a method based on the analysis of infrasound signals recorded by a small aperture array in Ischgl (Austria), which provides a significant improvement to overcome this limit. The method is based on array-derived wave parameters, such as back azimuth and apparent velocity. The method defines threshold criteria for automatic avalanche identification by considering avalanches as a moving source of infrasound. We validate the efficiency of the automatic infrasound detection with continuous observations with Doppler radar and we show how the velocity of a snow avalanche in any given path around the array can be efficiently derived. Our results indicate that a proper infrasound array analysis allows a robust, real-time, remote detection of snow avalanches that is able to provide the number and the time of occurrence of snow avalanches occurring all around the array, which represent key information for a proper validation of avalanche forecast models and risk management in a given area.",
      "summary": "This study addresses the challenge of timely snow avalanche detection for risk management. The authors present a method using infrasound signals recorded by an array in Austria. This method uses array-derived wave parameters and defines threshold criteria for automatic avalanche identification. The study validates the detection efficiency with Doppler radar, suggesting that infrasound array analysis enables robust, real-time remote detection of snow avalanches.",

We analysed near-regional-scale seismicity on the Arctic archipelago of Svalbard to identify seismic icequake signals and to study their spatial–temporal distribution within the 14-year period from 2000 until 2013. This is the first study that uses seismic data recorded on permanent broadband stations to detect and locate icequakes in different regions of Spitsbergen, the main island of the archipelago. A temporary local seismic network and direct observations of glacier calving and surging were used to identify icequake sources. We observed a high number of icequakes with clear spectral peaks between 1 and 8 Hz in different parts of Spitsbergen. Spatial clusters of icequakes could be associated with individual grounded tidewater glaciers and exhibited clear seasonal variability each year with more signals observed during the melt season. Locations at the termini of glaciers, and correlation with visual calving observations in situ at Kronebreen, a glacier in the Kongsfjorden region, show that these icequakes were caused dominantly by calving. Indirect evidence for glacier surging through increased calving seismicity was found in 2003 at Tunabreen, a glacier in central Spitsbergen. Another type of icequake was observed in the area of the Nathorstbreen glacier system. Seismic events occurred upstream of the glacier within a short time period between January and May 2009 during the initial phase of a major glacier surge. This study is the first step towards the generation and implementation of an operational seismic monitoring strategy for glacier dynamics in Svalbard.",

During the 2011 typhoon season, we deployed a seismic array along the Chishan River in the mountain area of southern Taiwan, where there is strong variability in water discharge and high sedimentation rates. We observe hysteresis in the high-frequency (5–15 Hz) seismic noise level relative to the associated hydrological parameters. In addition, our seismic noise analysis reveals an asymmetry and a high coherence in noise cross-correlation functions for several station pairs during the typhoon passage, which corresponds to sediment particles and turbulent flows impacting along the riverbed where the river bends sharply. Based on spectral characteristics of the seismic records, we also detected 20 landslide/debris flow events, which we use to estimate the sediment supply. Comparison of sediment flux between seismologically determined bedload and derived suspended load indicates temporal changes in the sediment flux ratio, which imply a complex transition process from the bedload regime to the suspension regime between typhoon passage and off-typhoon periods. Our study demonstrates the possibility of seismologically monitoring river bedload transport, thus providing valuable additional information for studying fluvial bedrock erosion and mountain landscape evolution.",

A detailed description of the mechanisms controlling the course of calving is essential for the reliable estimation and prediction of mass loss from glaciers. Here we present the potential of hydroacoustic methods to investigate different modes of ice detachments. High‐frequency underwater ambient noise recordings are combined with synchronized, high‐resolution, time‐lapse photography of the Hans Glacier cliff in Hornsund Fjord, Spitsbergen, to identify three types of calving events: typical subaerial, sliding subaerial, and submarine. A quantitative analysis of the data reveals a robust correlation between ice impact energy and acoustic emission at frequencies below 200 Hz for subaerial calving.

      "abstract": "Abstract. Rapid mass movements (RMM) pose a substantial risk to people and infrastructure. Reliable and cost-efficient measures have to be taken to reduce this risk. One of these measures includes establishing and advancing the state of practice in the application of early warning systems (EWSs). EWSs have been developed during the past decades and are rapidly increasing. In this paper, we focus on the technical part of EWSs, i.e., the prediction and timely recognition of imminent hazards, as well as on monitoring slopes at risk and released mass movements. Recent innovations in assessing spatial precipitation, monitoring and precursors of the triggering and deformation of RMM offer new opportunities for next-generation EWSs. However, technical advancement can only be transferred into more reliable, operational EWSs with an adequate well-instructed dedicated staff. To this end, an intense dialog between scientists, engineers and those in charge of warning, as well as further experience with new comprehensive prototype systems jointly operated by scientists and practitioners, will be essential.",
      "summary": "Rapid mass movements present significant dangers to populations and infrastructure. This paper examines the technical aspects of early warning systems designed to mitigate these risks. The study emphasizes prediction, hazard recognition, and monitoring of at-risk slopes and mass movements. The authors suggest that progress relies on collaboration between scientists, engineers, and those responsible for issuing warnings, along with practical experience using comprehensive prototype systems.",

      "abstract": "Catastrophic landslides involve the acceleration and deceleration of millions of tons of rock and debris in response to the forces of gravity and dissipation. Through real-time detection and inverse modeling of teleseismic data we show that landslide dynamics are primarily determined by the length scale of the source mass. When combined with geometric constraints from satellite imagery, the seismically determined landslide force histories yield estimates of landslide duration, momenta, potential energy loss, mass, and runout trajectory. Measurements of these dynamical properties for 29 teleseismogenic landslides are consistent with a simple acceleration model in which height drop and rupture depth scale with the length of the failing slope.",
      "summary": "This study presents a method for real-time seismic detection and inverse modeling of catastrophic landslides. Through analysis of long-period seismic waves, the authors develop a simple scaling relationship between landslide dynamics and seismic radiation. They demonstrate that seismically derived force histories can constrain fundamental parameters such as landslide mass, velocity, and runout distance. The approach is validated against well-documented events and reveals universal scaling behavior across catastrophic landslides spanning several orders of magnitude in volume.",

      "abstract": "Abstract. A large rock avalanche occurred at 03:27:30 PDT, 6 August 2010, in the Mount Meager Volcanic Complex southwest British Columbia. The landslide initiated as a rock slide in Pleistocene rhyodacitic volcanic rock with the collapse of the secondary peak of Mount Meager. The detached rock mass impacted the volcano's weathered and saturated flanks, creating a visible seismic signature on nearby seismographs. Undrained loading of the sloping flank caused the immediate and extremely rapid evacuation of the entire flank with a strong horizontal force, as the rock slide transformed into a debris flow. The disintegrating mass travelled down Capricorn Creek at an average velocity of 64 m s−1, exhibiting dramatic super-elevation in bends to the intersection of Meager Creek, 7.8 km from the source. At Meager Creek the debris impacted the south side of Meager valley, causing a runup of 270 m above the valley floor and the deflection of the landslide debris both upstream (for 3.7 km) and downstream into the Lillooet River valley (for 4.9 km), where it blocked the Lillooet River river for a couple of hours, approximately 10 km from the landslide source. Deposition at the Capricorn–Meager confluence also dammed Meager Creek for about 19 h creating a lake 1.5 km long. The overtopping of the dam and the predicted outburst flood was the basis for a night time evacuation of 1500 residents in the town of Pemberton, 65 km downstream. High-resolution GeoEye satellite imagery obtained on 16 October 2010 was used to create a post-event digital elevation model. Comparing pre- and post-event topography we estimate the volume of the initial displaced mass from the flank of Mount Meager to be 48.5 × 106 m3, the height of the path (H) to be 2183 m and the total length of the path (L) to be 12.7 km. This yields H/L = 0.172 and a fahrboschung (travel angle) of 9.75°. The movement was recorded on seismographs in British Columbia and Washington State with the initial impact, the debris flow travelling through bends in Capricorn Creek, and the impact with Meager Creek are all evident on a number of seismograms. The landslide had a seismic trace equivalent to a M = 2.6 earthquake. Velocities and dynamics of the movement were simulated using DAN-W. The 2010 event is the third major landslide in the Capricorn Creek watershed since 1998 and the fifth large-scale mass flow in the Meager Creek watershed since 1930. No lives were lost in the event, but despite its relatively remote location direct costs of the 2010 landslide are estimated to be in the order of $10 M CAD.",
      "summary": "This study investigates a significant rock slide-debris flow event that occurred at Mount Meager in British Columbia on August 6, 2010. The event began as a rock slide and transformed into a debris flow, traveling a considerable distance and impacting nearby valleys. Researchers used satellite imagery and seismic data to analyze the event's characteristics, volume, and dynamics. The analysis offers insights into hazard and risk assessment for similar events in the region.",

      "abstract": "Seismic amplitude-versus-angle (AVA) methods are a powerful means of quantifying the physical properties of subglacial material, but serious interpretative errors can arise when AVA is measured over a thinly-layered substrate. A substrate layer with a thickness less than 1/4 of the seismic wavelength, λ, is considered \"thin\", and reflections from its bounding interfaces superpose and appear in seismic data as a single reflection event. AVA interpretation of subglacial till can be vulnerable to such thin-layer effects, since a lodged (non-deforming) till can be overlain by a thin (metre-scale) cap of dilatant (deforming) till. We assess the potential for misinterpretation by simulating seismic data for a stratified subglacial till unit, with an upper dilatant layer between 0.1–5.0 m thick (λ / 120 to > λ / 4, with λ = 12 m). For dilatant layers less than λ / 6 thick, conventional AVA analysis yields acoustic impedance and Poisson's ratio that indicate contradictory water saturation. A thin-layer interpretation strategy is proposed, that accurately characterises the model properties of the till unit. The method is applied to example seismic AVA data from Russell Glacier, West Greenland, in which characteristics of thin-layer responses are evident. A subglacial till deposit is interpreted, having lodged till (acoustic impedance = 4.26±0.59 × 10 6 kg m −2 s −1 ) underlying a water-saturated dilatant till layer (thickness < 2 m, Poisson's ratio ~ 0.5). Since thin-layer considerations offer a greater degree of complexity in an AVA interpretation, and potentially avoid misinterpretations, they are a valuable aspect of quantitative seismic analysis, particularly for characterising till units.",

Here we develop quantitative estimates of fundamental rockslide properties (e.g., volume) based solely on data from an existing regional seismic network. We assembled a data set of twenty known rockslides in the central Alps (with volumes between 1,000 and 2,000,000 m3) and analyzed their corresponding seismograms. Common signal characteristics include emergent onsets, slowly decaying tails, and a triangular spectrogram shape.",

The authors demonstrate that fundamental rockslide properties, including volume, can be quantitatively estimated from seismic data alone. By analyzing seismic records from documented rock slope failures in the Swiss Alps, they establish empirical relationships between signal features (e.g., duration, amplitude, frequency content) and rockslide parameters. The methodology provides a remote characterization tool for rock slope failures in mountainous regions.",

P- and S-wave velocity structures were determined by travel-time tomography and inversion of Rayleigh wave dispersion curves, respectively. The average P- and S-wave velocities of ice are 3466 and 1839 m s-1, respectively. Radar velocities were obtained by migration velocity analysis of 112 diffraction events. An estimate of 920 kg m-3 for the bulk density of wet ice corresponds to water contents of 5.1 and 3.2%, which were derived from the average P-wave and radar velocities, respectively. Using this density and the average P- and S-wave velocities, we estimate that the corresponding incompressibility and rigidity of the ice are 6.925 and 3.119 GPa, respectively. Synergistic interpretation of the radar profile and P- and S-wave velocities indicates the presence of a fracture zone above a subglacial high. Here, the P- and S-wave velocities are approximately 5 and 3% less than in the ice above a subglacial valley, respectively. The S-wave velocities indicate that warmer and less rigid ice underlies 10–15 m of colder ice near the surface of the glacier. Such layering is characteristic of polythermal glaciers. As a relatively simple non-invasive approach, integration of P-wave tomography, Rayleigh wave inversion and ground-towed radar is effective for various glaciological studies, including the elastic properties of englacial and subglacial materials, cold/warm ice interfaces, topography of a glacier bed and location of fracture zones.",
